title: Threat Models and Security Profiles
---

Running any software that stores personal information exposes the
developer/company to risks. Analyzing which threat agents pose a risk,
understanding the possible motivations for an attack, or why an agent is a
threat, knowing the attack surface, the likelihood, and the impact are important
all aspects of a threat model.

This documentation can not substitute a thorough and serious threat model, yet
it will provide some guidelines to help configure ORY Kratos in a way that makes
it best suited for any risk assessment.

Please be aware that this chapter is still work in progress. Not all mitigation
strategies have been implemented yet in ORY Kratos!

## Understanding Threats

This section examines several threat vectors in systems that manage identities.

### Account Enumeration Attacks

> "Often, web applications reveal when a username exists on system, either as a
> consequence of a misconfiguration or as a design decision. For example,
> sometimes, when we submit wrong credentials, we receive a message that states
> that either the username is present on the system or the provided password is
> wrong. The information obtained can be used by an attacker to gain a list of
> users on system. This information can be used to attack the web application,
> for example, through a brute force or default username/password attack.
> Description of the Issue"

#### Scenarios

Considering the above, an example would be for example an adult website. A
threat agent wants to blackmail a well known politician by checking if someone
can sign up at that website using the `well-known-politician@email.com` email.

If the service responds with
`Sorry, that email is already signed up here. Did you try to log in instead?`,
the agent is able to proceed with some type of blackmail scheme.

[OWASP defines several Black-Box tests](<https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OWASP-AT-002)#Black_Box_testing_and_example>)
that cover Account Enumeration Scenarios.

#### Mitigation

ORY Kratos can be configured to send an out-of-band message to the email used
for login, registration, account recovery, etc.:

- If an application or user tries to sign in using an unknown email address, an
  email will be sent to that address reading "You tried to sign in at X but you
  do not have an account yet, did you mean to sign up instead?"
- ...

### Bruteforce Attacks

Will be addressed in a future release.

### Phishing Attacks

Will be addressed in a future release.

### Social Engineering Attacks

Will be addressed in a future release.

### SMS Spoofing Attacks

Will be addressed in a future release.

## Choosing the right Security Profile and Configuration

Will be addressed in a future release.

### Argon2

ORY Kratos uses Argon2 for password hashing. Argon2 is the official winner of
the PHC 2017. You can tweak the Argon2 configuration in your ORY Kratos
configuration file:

```yaml
hashers:
  argon2:
    memory: 1048576
    iterations: 2
    parallelism: 4
    salt_length: 16
    key_length: 32
```

## Digital Identity Guidelines

There is no one standard to digital identity. ORY Kratos closely follows
emerging frameworks and guidelines such as:
[Digital Identity Guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)
(and a follow-up [FAQ](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)) .

As ORY Kratos grows, this document will continue to expand and add sections
covering individual security recommendations established by NIST.

### Password Policy

Almost every service with a login offers some type of registration using a
password. Therefore, there are many strategies floating around, with many of
them implementing terrible and insecure patterns such as:

- Not allowing special characters in passwords.
- Not allowing the use of password managers by disabling the "paste"
  functionality in password fields.
- Requiring you to rotate your password every month (passwords expire).
- ...

Troy Hunt has written an
[excellent piece on password policies](https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/)
and why they recently changed and how.

ORY Kratos implements a password policy that:

- Checks if a password has previously been leaked using the
  [HIBP API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2),
- Checks if a password is too similar to one of the identifiers (in a future
  release [kratos#184](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/184)),
- Makes passwords not expire.

This is a rundown of all the practices ORY Kratos implements and why. **Some
things need to be implemented by yourself** as they must be implemented in the
User Interface that interfaces with ORY Kratos. You can find these in section
[User Interface Guidelines](#user-interface-guidelines).

#### Password Complexity

This outline and quotes are defined in the
[NIST Digital Identity Guidelines - 5.1.1.2 Memorized Secret Verifiers](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).
ORY Kratos, unless explicitly advertised, implements these guidelines and best
practices.

Passwords must have a minimum length of 8 characters and all characters
(unicode, ASCII) must be allowed:

> Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8
> characters in length. Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized
> secrets at least 64 characters in length. All printing ASCII [RFC 20]
> characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized
> secrets. Unicode [ISO/ISC 10646] characters SHOULD be accepted as well. To
> make allowances for likely mistyping, verifiers MAY replace multiple
> consecutive space characters with a single space character prior to
> verification, provided that the result is at least 8 characters in length.
> Truncation of the secret SHALL NOT be performed. For purposes of the above
> length requirements, each Unicode code point SHALL be counted as a single
> character.

Passwords must be checked against a database of compromised secrets such as
[Have I Been Pwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com):

> When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers
> SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values
> known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list MAY
> include, but is not limited to:
>
> - Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses.
> - Dictionary words.
> - Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’).
> - Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and
>   derivatives thereof.
>
> If the chosen secret is found in the list, the CSP or verifier SHALL advise
> the subscriber that they need to select a different secret, SHALL provide the
> reason for rejection, and SHALL require the subscriber to choose a different
> value.

Show the user a password-strength meter (to be implemented, see
[#136](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/136)):

> Verifiers SHOULD offer guidance to the subscriber, such as a password-strength
> meter [Meters], to assist the user in choosing a strong memorized secret. This
> is particularly important following the rejection of a memorized secret on the
> above list as it discourages trivial modification of listed (and likely very
> weak) memorized secrets

Do not require mixtures of characters types or prohibiting repeated characters:

> Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures
> of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters)
> for memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be
> changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically). However, verifiers SHALL force a
> change if there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.

#### User Interface Guidelines

These best practices need to be implemented in your User Interface and can not
be handled by ORY Kratos. All ORY-built reference and demo applications
implement these best practices:

Allow pasting of passwords:

> Verifiers SHOULD permit claimants to use “paste” functionality when entering a
> memorized secret. This facilitates the use of password managers, which are
> widely used and in many cases increase the likelihood that users will choose
> stronger memorized secrets.

Allow the user to show the secret in the UI:

> In order to assist the claimant in successfully entering a memorized secret,
> the verifier SHOULD offer an option to display the secret — rather than a
> series of dots or asterisks — until it is entered. This allows the claimant to
> verify their entry if they are in a location where their screen is unlikely to
> be observed. The verifier MAY also permit the user’s device to display
> individual entered characters for a short time after each character is typed
> to verify correct entry. This is particularly applicable on mobile devices.

#### Password Hints

> Memorized secret verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a “hint”
> that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant.
>
> [NIST Digital Identity Guidelines - 5.1.1.2 Memorized Secret Verifiers](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

#### Password Expiry

> Forcing password expiry carries no real benefits because:
>
> - the user is likely to choose new passwords that are only minor variations of
>   the old
> - stolen passwords are generally exploited immediately
> - resetting the password gives you no information about whether a compromise
>   has occurred
> - an attacker with access to the account will probably also receive the
>   request to reset the password
> - if compromised via insecure storage, the attacker will be able to find the
>   new password in the same place
