Account Recovery must be performed if access to an account needs to be
recovered. Common use cases include:

- "Forgot password" flows
- "Lost MFA device" flows
- ...

To recover an account, two principal flows are supported:

- Browser-based (easy): This flow works for all applications running on top of a
  browser. Websites, single-page apps, Cordova/Ionic, and so on.
- API-based (advanced): This flow works for native applications like iOS
  (Swift), Android (Java), Microsoft (.NET), React Native, Electron, and others.

The flow described here is implemented by the
[link](user-settings/password-reset-recovery-link.mdx) strategy.

## Self-Service Account Recovery for Browser Applications

ORY Kratos supports browser applications that run on server-side (e.g. Java,
NodeJS, PHP) as well as client-side (e.g. JQuery, ReactJS, AngularJS, ...).

Browser-based account recovery makes use of three core HTTP technologies:

- HTTP Redirects
- HTTP POST (`application/json`, `application/x-www-urlencoded`) and RESTful GET
  requests.
- HTTP Cookies to prevent CSRF and Session Hijaking attack vectors.

The browser flow is the easiest and most secure to set up and integrated with.
ORY Kratos takes care of all required session and CSRF cookies and ensures that
all security requirements are fulfilled.

This flow is not suitable for scenarios where you use purely programmatic
clients that do not work well with HTTP Cookies and HTTP Redirects.

### The Account Recovery User Interface

The Account Recovery User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application
that renders the account recovery User Interface / HTML Form.

```html
<!-- Recover account by sending recovery link to specified email -->
<form action="..." method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="cdef..." />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

Reference these UI endpoints your ORY Kratos config file:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    recovery:
      ui_url: https://.../recovery
```

You should also configure how long a session is privileged. The user will only
be able to update his/her password (or any other credential) for the specified
amount of time after completing the recovery flow.

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      privileged_session_max_age: 15m
```

<p>
  <figure>
    <img
      alt="Recovery email sent to unknown address"
      src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/secureapp-recovery-change.png')}
    />
    <figcaption>
      The user is instructed to update her/his password or set up credentials
      such as Social Sign In.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

Each Recovery Strategy
([Recovery Link](account-recovery/password-reset-recovery-link.mdx), ...) is
different, but they all boil down to the same abstract sequence:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
sequenceDiagram
  participant B as Browser
  participant K as ORY Kratos
  participant A as Your Application
  B->>K: Initiate Account Recovery
  K->>B: Redirects to your Application's /recovery_ui endpoint
  B->>A: Calls /recovery_ui
  A-->>K: Fetches data to render forms etc
  B-->>A: Fills out forms (e.g. email), clicks "recover account"
  B->>K: POSTs data to
  K-->>K: Processes Account Recovery Info
  alt Data is valid
    K-->>+B: Issues recovery challenge (e.g. send email)
    K->>B: Shows in the UI that the user must e.g. click link in email
    B->>-K: Completes challenge and recovers account(e.g. GET .../recover?token=abc)
    K->>B: Redirects to Settings page to update e.g. password
  else Post data is invalid
    K-->>B: Redirects to your Applicaiton's /recovery_ui endpoint
    B->>A: Calls /recovery_ui
    A-->>K: Fetches data to render form fields and errors
    B-->>A: Fills out forms again, corrects errors
    B->>K: POSTs data again - and so on...
  end
`}
/>

### Code

The code example used here is universal and does not use an SDK because we want
you to understand the fundamentals of how this flow works.

While this example assumes a Server-Side Application, a Client-Side (e.g.
ReactJS) Application would work the same, but use ORY Kratos' Public API
instead.

#### Server-side route

You will notice that this endpoint is very similar to the one documented for
[User Settings](user-settings.mdx).

```js
// Uses the ORY Kratos NodeJS SDK - for more SDKs check:
//
//  https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/sdk/index
const { CommonApi } = require('@oryd/kratos-client')

// The browser config key is used to redirect the user. It reflects where ORY Kratos' Public API
// is accessible from. Here, we're assuming traffic going to `http://example.org/.ory/kratos/public/`
// will be forwarded to ORY Kratos' Public API.
const kratosBrowserUrl = 'http://example.org/.ory/kratos/public/'

// Initializes the SDK with ORY Kratos' Admin API.
const commonApi = new CommonApi('https://ory-kratos-admin.example-org.vpc/')

// This route would be used like:
//
//    app.get('/recover', recoveryHandler)
//
export const recoveryHandler = (req, res, next) => {
  // The request ID is used to identify the Account Recovery Request and
  // return data like the csrf_token and so on.
  const request = req.query.request
  if (!request) {
    console.log('No request found in URL, initializing flow.')
    res.redirect(`${kratosBrowserUrl}/self-service/browser/flows/recovery`)
    return
  }

  commonApi
    .getSelfServiceBrowserRecoveryRequest(request)
    .then(({ body, response }) => {
      if (response.statusCode !== 200) {
        res.redirect(`${kratosBrowserUrl}/self-service/browser/flows/recovery`)
        return
      }

      // "body" contains all the request data for this Recovery request.
      // You can process that data here, if you want.

      // Lastly, you probably want to render the data using a view (e.g. Jade Template):
      res.render('recovery', body)
    })
  // Handle errors using ExpressJS' next functionality:
  //
  //    .catch(next)
}
```

#### Views

Implementing the view is simple as ORY Kratos provides you with all the
information you need for rendering the forms. The following example illustrates
a generic form generator (we use handlebars here) that works with ORY Kratos:

```handlebars name="views/partials/form.hbs"
<form action="{{form.action}}" method="{{form.method}}">
    {{~#each form.errors~}}
        <!-- global form validation errors -->
        <div class="error">{{message}}</div>
    {{~/each~}}

    {{#each form.fields}}
        {{~#each errors~}}
            <!-- validation errors for this specific field -->
            <div class="error">{{message}}</div>
        {{~/each~}}
        <input name="{{name}}" type="{{type}}" value="{{value}}" {{#if disabled}}disabled{{/if}}>
    {{/each}}

    <button type="submit">Save</button>
</form>
```

In your main "Recovery" view you would then consume this template for all the
methods you want to support:

```handlebars name="views/recovery.hbs"
<!-- Make profile changes form: -->
{{#if methods.link.config}}
    {{> form form=methods.profile.config}}
{{/if}}

<!-- ... form: -->
<!-- ... -->
```

### Server-Side Browser Applications

Let's take a look at the concrete network topologies, calls, and payloads. Here,
we're assuming that you're running a server-side browser application (written in
e.g. PHP, Java, NodeJS) to render the recovery screen on the server and make all
API calls from that server code. The counterpart to this would be a client-side
browser application (written in e.g. Vanilla JavaScript, JQuery, ReactJS,
AngularJS, ...) that uses AJAX requests to fetch data. For these type of
applications, read this section first and go to section
[Client-Side Browser Applications](#client-side-browser-applications) next.

#### Network Architecture

We recommend checking out the
[Quickstart Network Architecture](../../quickstart.mdx#network-architecture) for
a high-level, exemplary, overview of the network. In summary:

1. The SecureApp (your application) is exposed at http://127.0.0.1:4455 and
   proxies requests matching path `./ory/kratos/public/*` to ORY Krato's Public
   API Port.
1. ORY Kratos exposes (for debugging only!!) the Public API at
   http://127.0.0.1:4433 and Admin API at http://127.0.0.1:4434.
1. Within the "intranet" or "private network", ORY Kratos is exposed at
   http://kratos:4433 and http://kratos:4434. These URLs are be used by the
   SecureApp to communicate with ORY Kratos.

Keep in mind that his architecture is just one of many possible network
architectures. It is however one of the simplest as well and it works locally.
For production deployments you would probably use an Reverse Proxy such as
Nginx, Kong, Envoy, ORY Oathkeeper, or others.

#### Account Recovery Process Sequence

The Account Recovery Flow is composed of several high-level steps summarized in
this state diagram:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: User tries to log in but forgot e.g. password
  s3: User ends up at recovery_ui which renders the Account Recovery Form
  s4: Recovery over secondary channel (e.g. email) is initiated
  s5: Update "Account Recovery Request" with Error Context(s)
  s6: Settings update successful
	[*] --> s1
  s1 --> s3 : User clicks "Recover Account" and is redirected to Recovery Init Endpoint
  s3 --> s4 : User provides valid form data
  s3 --> s5 : User provides invalid form data (e.g. not an email)
  s5 --> s3 : User is redirected to Settings UI URL
  s4 --> s6
  s6 --> [*]
  Error --> [*]
`}
/>

First, the flow is initiated by directing the user's browser to
`http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/recovery`.
This is called the "Account Recovery Init Endpoint".

Next, ORY Kratos does some internal processing (e.g. checks if a session cookie
is set, generates payloads for form fields, sets CSRF token, ...) and redirects
the user's browser to the Recovery UI URL which is defined using the
`selfservice.flows.recovery.ui_url` config or
`SELFSERVICE_FLOWS_RECOVERY_UI_URL` environment variable, which is set to the ui
endpoints - for example `https://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery`.

The user's browser is thus redirected to
`https://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery?request=abcde`. The `request` query parameter
includes a unique ID which will be used to fetch contextual data for this
recovery request.

Your Server-Side Application makes a `GET` request to
`http://kratos:4434/self-service/browser/flows/requests/recovery?request=abcde`.
ORY Kratos responds with a JSON Payload that contains data (form fields, error
messages, ...) for all enabled Account Recovery Strategies:

```json5
{
  id: '4f49fd6b-fd13-4de2-ac66-adeffa5e5fe3',
  expires_at: '2020-07-02T15:41:22.1559315Z',
  issued_at: '2020-07-02T14:41:22.1559545Z',
  request_url: 'http://kratos:4433/self-service/browser/flows/recovery',
  methods: {
    link: {
      /* ... */
    }
  },
  state: 'sent_email'
}
```

Once the strategy is completed successfully (e.g. an email has been entered into
the form and the user clicked submit), the user will be signed in and sent to
the [User Settings](user-settings.mdx) page with a privileged session, meaning
that he/she is able to change the password in the next e.g. 15 minutes.

    end
  else Form data is invalid
    Note over KP,B: User must retry settings flow because of validation error
    KP->>B: HTTP 302 Found /recovery?request=abcde
  end
`}
/>

### Client-Side Browser Applications

Because Client-Side Browser Applications do not have access to ORY Kratos' Admin
API, they must use the ORY Kratos Public API instead. The flow for a Client-Side
Browser Application is almost the exact same as the one for Server-Side
Applications, with the small difference that
`https://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/requests/recovery?request=abcde`
would be called via AJAX instead of making a request to
`https://kratos:4434/self-service/browser/flows/requests/recovery?request=abcde`.

To prevent brute force, guessing, session injection, and other attacks, it is
required that cookies are working for this endpoint. The cookie set in the
initial HTTP request made to
`https://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/recovery` MUST
be set and available when calling this endpoint!

:::info

The initialization request
(`http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public/self-service/browser/flows/recovery`)
**cannot** be made via AJAX or API requests. You **must** open that URL in the
user's browser using e.g. `window.open` `location.href` or plain and simple old
`<a href=...>`.
