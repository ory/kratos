When working with cookies, keep the following in mind:

1. HTTP Cookies **are not port specific**. If a cookie is set on
   `https://mydomain.com:1234` it is also valid for `https://mydomain.com:4321`
   and `https://mydomain.com`.
2. Unless `--dev` is set, Ory Kratos' cookies are only sent over HTTPS.
3. Cookies in Ory Kratos are always `httpOnly`.
4. It is possible to set a cookie for `mydomain.com` when the original request
   was made to `subdomain.mydomain.com`. It is however not possible to set a
   cookie for `anotherdomain.com` when the original request was made to
   `mydomain.com`. See also
   [this answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain).

:::note

Ory Kratos uses pass-by-value cookies whose values are encrypted using the
`secrets.default` / `secrets.cookie` secrets. If these secrets are changed
without doing proper [secret / key rotation](secret-key-rotation), all cookies
will be invalid which will cause users to be signed out, and other side effects.

## Session Cookies

CloudRun, Heroku, and other "serverless" solutions commonly expose services
directly to the public, and do not allow for fronting by a gateway or reverse
proxy. In those cases, your application architecture may separate services by
subdomain (e.g. `service1.myproduct.com`, `service2.myproduct.com`,
`service3.myproduct.com`, ...).

If that is the case you can change the session
[cookie domain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) and
path using the following configuration keys in your Ory Kratos configuration:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    domain: myproduct.com
```

It is also possible to restrict the
[cookie path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies):

:::note

It is very unlikely that you need to change this!

:::

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    path: /some/sub-directory
```

You can also modify the new
[HTTP Cookie SameSite Attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite)
using:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    same_site: Lax
```
