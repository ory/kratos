id: error
title: This should be the Error UI

You ended up here because you did not set the following configuration value:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
selfservice:
  flows:
    error:
      ui_url: http://my-app.com/error
```

You can set this configuration value using environment variable
`SELFSERVICE_FLOWS_ERROR_UI_URL` as well!

If you don't know what that means, head over to
[User-Facing Error](../self-service/flows/user-facing-errors.md)!
