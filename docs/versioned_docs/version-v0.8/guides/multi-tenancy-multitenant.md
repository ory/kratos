Ory Kratos does not implement multi-tenancy in its application logic, but it is
possible to implement multi-tenancy with Ory Kratos!

The recommended approach is to run one or more (depending on your scale) SQL
databases and create one database schema per tenant in these database instances.
So one PostgreSQL database instance could, for example, host 15000 tenants who
each have access to one schema.

Ory Kratos itself should run as one instance per tenant with a configuration
tailored for that specific tenant. The minimum required change is using
different secrets and the tenant's DSN
(`postgresql://user:pass@.../tenant-123`). Because Ory Kratos is very
lightweight, the deployment overhead becomes negligible.

While deployment complexity increases - but is addressable with e.g.
Kubernetes - this approach has several advantages:

- Absolute isolation of tenants which implies: better security, better privacy,
  more control.
- Easy sharding and partitioning because database schemas isolate tenants.
- No complexity in Ory Kratos' business logic and security defenses.
