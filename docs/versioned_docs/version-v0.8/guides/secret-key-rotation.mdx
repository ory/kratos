title: Secret and Key Rotation
---

Ory Kratos needs secrets that are used for encrypting, decrypting, generating
and validating signatures, and other cryptographic tasks.

These secrets must have high entropy (>= 256 bit). It is also a good idea to
rotate the keys every now and then. Assuming you have the following secrets
configured

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
secrets:
  default:
    - old-default-secret
  cookie:
    - old-cookie-secret
  cipher:
    - old-32-long-secret-key
```

and want to rotate these secrets, you would add the new secrets to the top of
the list and keep the old secrets around. This allows the system to verify and
decrypt things that have been signed/encrypted with the old secret, while
generating new signatures and encrypting new things using the new secret:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
secrets:
  default:
    - new-default-secret
    - old-default-secret
  cookie:
    - new-cookie-secret
    - old-cookie-secret
  cipher:
    - new-secret-key
    - old-secret-key
```

The cipher secrets are use for now to encrypt and decrypt tokens from oidc
authentication method.
