## kratos migrate sql

Create SQL schemas and apply migration plans

### Synopsis

Run this command on a fresh SQL installation and when you upgrade Ory Kratos to
a new minor version.

It is recommended to run this command close to the SQL instance (e.g. same
subnet) instead of over the public internet. This decreases risk of failure and
decreases time required.

You can read in the database URL using the -e flag, for example: export DSN=...
kratos migrate sql -e

### WARNING

Before running this command on an existing database, create a back up!

```
kratos migrate sql &lt;database-url&gt; [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -c, --config strings   Path to one or more .json, .yaml, .yml, .toml config files. Values are loaded in the order provided, meaning that the last config file overwrites values from the previous config file.
  -h, --help             help for sql
  -e, --read-from-env    If set, reads the database connection string from the environment variable DSN or config file key dsn.
  -y, --yes              If set all confirmation requests are accepted without user interaction.
```
