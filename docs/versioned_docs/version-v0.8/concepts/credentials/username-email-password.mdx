title: Username / Email & Password
---

The `password` method is the most commonly used form of authentication, it
requires an `identifier` (username, email, phone number, ...) and a `password`
during registration and login.

Ory Kratos hashes the password after registration, password reset, and password
change using:

- BCrypt (default).
- [Argon2](../security.mdx#Argon2)

## Configuration

Enabling this method is as easy as setting

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
```

in your Ory Kratos configuration.

You can configure the BCrypt hasher using the following options:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
hashers:
  algorithm: bcrypt
```

:::warning

Due to the way BCrypt is implemented in Golang, passwords will be truncated
after 72 characters before being hashed. This implies that all characters in the
password after position 72 will be ignored!

:::

Bcrypt algorithm can be configured only by the following `cost` option (default
value is 12):

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
hashers:
  bcrypt:
    cost: 12
```

By default, Kratos uses BCrypt algorithm for password hashing. Use the following
option to use the Argon2id algorithm:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
hashers:
  argon2:
    parallelism: 1
    memory: 128MB
    iterations: 3
    salt_length: 16
    key_length: 32
```

To determine the ideal parameters, head over to the
[setup guide](../../guides/setting-up-password-hashing-parameters).

When a user signs up using this method, the Default Identity Schema (set using
`identity.default_schema_url`) is used:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
identity:
  default_schema_url: file:///path/to/default-identity.schema.json
  # also works with HTTP(S):
  #
  # default_schema_url: https://mydomain.com/path/to/default-identity.schema.json
```

If you don't know what that means, please read the
[Identity Schema Chapter](../../concepts/identity-schema.mdx) in the docs'
concepts section.

For a complete reference, defaults, and description please check the
[Configuration Reference](../../reference/configuration.md).

Configuration, head over to [Argon2 Security](../security.mdx#argon2).

## Choosing between Username, Email, Phone Number

Before you start, you need to decide what data you want to collect from your
users and why! It is hard to change this decision afterwards, so make sure
you've taken everything into account!

When logging in, the user will use a login identifier and a password to sign up
and in. The identifier can be

- a username - e.g. "john.doe" or "johndoe123" or "oryuser",
- an email address - e.g. `john.doe@gmail.com`,
- a phone number - e.g. `+49-1234-4321-1234-4321`.

All of these approaches have up- and downsides.

Using the email address as the login identifier is easy to remember, does not
require additional fields (because the email address is already being
collected), and is usually unique. It's usually unique because sometimes
companies use a "shared" email account (e.g. office@acme.org) to access
services. In that case, multiple real identities are using the same email
identifier to log in.

The email address however represents a unique identifier and personally
identifiable information (PII). An attacker could for example check if an email
address (e.g. `john.doe@gmail.com`) is registered at a site (e.g. an adult
website) and use that information for blackmail (see
[Account Enumeration Attacks](../security.mdx#account-enumeration-attacks)).

The same considerations apply to using a phone number as the primary
registration & login identifier.

Using a free text username reduces the privacy risk because it is much harder to
make a connection between the username and a real world identity. It's still
possible in cases where users choose a username such as
"john.doe.from.newyork.1970", but finding the right username identifier is still
difficult and there is plausible deniability because anyone could use that
username.

A free text username however requires capturing additional fields (e.g. an email
address for password resets / account recovery) and is hard to remember. It is
often very difficult to find unique usernames as people tend to use a
combination of their names and initials (e.g. `john.doe`) which has a high
chance of collision. Therefore, one ends up with usernames such as
`john.doe1234432`.

It is important to understand that Ory Kratos lowercases all `password`
identifiers and therefore E-Mail addresses. Characters `+` or `.` which have
special meaning for some E-Mail Providers (e.g. GMail) are not normalized:

- `userNAME` is equal to `username`
- `foo@BaR.com` is equal to `foo@bar.com`
- `foo+baz@bar.com` is NOT equal to `foo@bar.com`
- `foo.baz@bar.com` is NOT equal to `foobaz@bar.com`

You need to decide which route you want to take.

### Picking the right Identity Schema

When processing an identity and its traits, the method will use
[JSON Schema](../../reference/json-schema-json-paths.md) to extract one or more
identifiers.

#### Use Case: Email and Password

To use the email address as the login identifier, define the following Identity
JSON Schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Case: Multiple E-Mails and Password

You can allow users to sign up with multiple E-Mail Addresses and use any of
those for log in:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "emails": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "email",
            "ory.sh/kratos": {
              "credentials": {
                "password": {
                  "identifier": true
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Case: Username and Password

To use a username as the login identifier, define the following Identity JSON
Schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "username": {
          "type": "string",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Use Case: Username and Email and Password

You may also mix usernames and passwords:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/registration.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "username": {
          "type": "string",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Use Case: Phone Number And Password

> This will be addressed in a future release and is tracked as
> [kratos#137](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/137).

## Hashed Password Format

### BCrypt

Ory Kratos can hash passwords by BCrypt and can compare stored BCrypt hash and
migrate if configured hasher (`hashers.algorithm`) is not BCrypt.

#### Format

BCrypt format is described
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt#Description).

### Argon2

Ory Kratos can hash passwords by Argon2 and can compare stored Argon2 hash and
migrate if configured hasher (`hashers.algorithm`) is not Argon2.

#### Format

`$argon2id$v=<version>$m=<memory>,t=<iterations>,p=<parallelism>$<hash>`

#### Parameters

- `version`(`number`): The current version.
- `memory`(`number`): Amount of memory to use.
- `iterations`(`number`): Number of iterations to perform.
- `parallelism`(`number`): Degree of parallelism.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the Argon2 algorithm encoded in
  base64.

#### Example

`$argon2id$v=19$m=32,t=2,p=4$cm94YnRVOW5jZzFzcVE4bQ$MNzk5BtR2vUhrp6qQEjRNw`

### PBKDF2

Ory Kratos doesn't hash passwords by PBKDF2 but can compare stored PBKDF2 hash
and migrate to configured hasher (`hashers.algorithm`).

But Kratos doesn't have ability to import credentials now. There is an open
issue for this feature:[Issue](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/605).

#### Format

`$pbkdf2-<algorithm>$i=<iteration>,l=<length>$<salt>$<hash>`

#### Parameters

- `digest`(`string`): The HMAC digest algorithm applied to derive a key of the
  input password.
- `iterations`(`number`): The number of iterations desired. The higher the
  number of iterations, the more secure the derived key will be, but will take a
  longer amount of time to complete.
- `length`(`number`): Length in octets of derived key.
- `salt`(`string`): A sequence of bits, known as a cryptographic salt encoded in
  base64.
- `hash`(`string`): The computed derived key by the PBKDF2 algorithm encoded in
  base64.

#### Example

`$pbkdf2-sha256$i=100000,l=32$1jP+5Zxpxgtee/iPxGgOz0RfE9/KJuDElP1ley4VxXc$QJxzfvdbHYBpydCbHoFg3GJEqMFULwskiuqiJctoYpI`

## Example

Assuming your Identity Schema is as follows:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://example.com/example.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "first_name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "username": {
          "type": "string",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

And an identity registers with the following JSON payload (more on registration
in [Selfservice Registration](../../self-service/flows/user-registration.mdx)):

```json
{
  "traits": {
    "first_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.org",
    "username": "johndoe123"
  },
  "password": "my-secret-password"
}
```

The `password` method would generate a credentials block as follows:

```yaml
credentials:
  password:
    id: password
    identifiers:
      - john.doe@example.org
      - johndoe123
    config:
      hashed_password: ... # this would be a hash of `my-secret-password` string
```

Because credential identifiers need to be unique, no other identity can be
created that has `johndoe123` or `john.doe@example.org` as their `email` or
`username`.
