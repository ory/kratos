title: 2FA TOTP (Google Authenticator)
---

Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) is a standardized algorithm (see
[RFC6238](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238)) that is used by apps
supported by apps like Google Authenticator
([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)),
[1Password](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/),
[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/help/article/authenticator-keys/), and many
others.

## Configuration

Enabling this method is as easy as setting

```yaml title="kratos.config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    totp:
      enabled: true
      config:
        # The issuer (e.g. a domain name) will be shown in the TOTP app (e.g. Google Authenticator). It helps the user differentiate between different codes.
        issuer: Example.com
```

### Identity Schema

To help the user identify the correct code in their TOTP authenticator app, you
should set the `issuer` (see code example above) to your brand name or domain
name. However, users might have multiple identities registered in your system.
To help them distinguish between them, you can specify a traits in your Identity
Schema which should be the TOTP account name (in the screenshot above
`alice@example.org`):

```patch title="identity.schema.json"
{
  $schema: 'http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#',
  type: 'object',
  properties: {
    traits: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        email: {
          type: 'string',
          format: 'email',
          title: 'Your E-Mail',
          minLength: 3,
          'ory.sh/kratos': {
            credentials: {
              // ...
+             totp: {
+               account_name: true
+             }
            }
            // ...
          }
        }
        // ...
      }
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Identity Credentials

The `totp` method would generate a credentials block as follows:

```yaml
credentials:
  password:
    id: totp
    identifiers:
      # This is the identity's ID
      - 802471b9-06f5-49d4-a88d-5e7d6bcfed22
    config:
      # This is the TOTP URL which contains the pre-shared key and some additional meta-information.
      totp_url: otpauth://totp/Example:alice@example.org?secret=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP&issuer=Example
```
