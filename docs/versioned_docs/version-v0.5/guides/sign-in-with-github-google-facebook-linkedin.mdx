In this document we will take a look at setting up "Sign in with GitHub" using
ORY Kratos.

Run the [Quickstart](../quickstart.mdx) with Docker Compose:

```shell script
# This assumes that you have ORY Kratos checked out locally and
# that your current directory ("pwd") is the folder where ORY Kratos
# is.

$ make quickstart
```

:::info

It is very important to add the "session" hook to the after oidc registration
hooks. Otherwise your users need to use the login flow again to be able to get a
session.

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        oidc:
          hooks:
            - hook: session
```

## Discord

To set up "Sign in with Discord" you must create a
[Discord OAuth2 Application](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2).

Set the "Redirect URI" to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/discord
```

The pattern of this URL is:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

The provider ID must point to the provider's ID set in the ORY Kratos
configuration file (explained in further detail at
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx)).

:::note

Discord does not implement OpenID Connect. Therefore, ORY Kratos makes a request
to
[Discord's User API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/user#get-current-user)
and adds that data to `std.extVar('claims')`. However, not all fields are
supported. Check the list of supported fields
[in Kratos' source code](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/v0.5.1-alpha.1/selfservice/strategy/oidc/provider_discord.go#L81-L91).

The `identify` scope will add following fields:

```text
iss                 # always https://discord.com/api/v6/oauth2/
sub                 # numeric discord user id
name                # username + # + discriminator
nickname            # username
preferred_username  # username
picture             # avatar url
locale              # user locale
```

Additionally, the `email` scope will add:

```text
email               # user email
email_verified      # whether email is verified
```

:::

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.discord.jsonnet"
local claims = {
  email_verified: false
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by Discord.
      [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Now, enable the Discord provider in the ORY Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: discord # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: discord
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by Discord
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by Discord
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.discord.jsonnet
            scope:
              - identify
              - email
```

Discord is now an option to log in via Kratos.

## GitHub

<iframe

  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hz_dP5c_qvc"
  frameborder="0"
  allowfullscreen
/>

To set up "Sign in with GitHub" you must create a
[GitHub OAuth2 Client](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

Set the "Authorization callback URL" to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/github
```

The pattern of this URL is:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>//self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

The provider ID must point to the provider's ID set in the ORY Kratos
configuration file (explained in further detail at
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx)).

:::note

GitHub does not implement OpenID Connect. Therefore, ORY Kratos makes a request
to
[GitHub's User API](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/#get-the-authenticated-user)
and adds that data to `std.extVar('claims')`. Check out what data is available
at
[GitHub's Scope Docs](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/understanding-scopes-for-oauth-apps/).
Not all GitHub fields are supported however. Check the list of supported fields
[in Kratos' source code](https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/v0.2.1-alpha.1/selfservice/strategy/oidc/provider_github.go#L72-L98).

:::

As explained in
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx),
you must also create a Jsonnet code snippet for the provider. Save the code in
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.github.jsonnet`.
The following JsonNet takes `email_primary` and maps it to `traits.email`:

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.github.jsonnet"
local claims = {
  email_verified: false
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by GitHub.
      [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Now, enable the GitHub provider in the ORY Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: github # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: github
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by GitHub
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by GitHub
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.github.jsonnet
            scope:
              - user:email
```

Next, open the login endpoint of the SecureApp and you should see the GitHub
Login option!

## GitLab

To set up "Sign in with GitLab" you must create a
[GitLab OAuth2 Application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#adding-an-application-through-the-profile).

Set the "Redirect URI" to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/gitlab
```

The pattern of this URL is:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

:::note

While you can use
[GitLab as an OIDC identity provider](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/openid_connect_provider.html),
GitLab only returns the sub and sub_legacy claims in the ID token. Therefore,
ORY Kratos makes a request to
[GitLab's /oauth/userinfo API](https://gitlab.com/oauth/userinfo) and adds the
user info to `std.extVar('claims')`.

:::

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.gitlab.jsonnet"
local claims = {
  email_verified: false
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by GitLab.
      [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Now, enable the GitLab provider in the ORY Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: gitlab # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: gitlab
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by GitLab
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by GitLab
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.gitlab.jsonnet
            scope:
              - read_user
              - openid
              - profile
              - email
```

GitLab is now an option to log in via Kratos.

## Microsoft

This will enable you to log in using any Azure AD directory - Multitenant and
personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox) depending on the settings made
when creating the application in Azure AD.

#### Creating an Application in Azure AD

To set up "Sign in with Microsoft" you must first
[register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).

Select "Web" as the "Redirect URI" type, and set the URI to:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>//self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

After the "App Registration" is created, make note of the `Application ID` and
`Directory ID` on top of the Overview page. To create the client secret,
navigate to "Certificates & secrets" and click "+ New client secret". Remember
to copy the secret value as it will only be shown once.

#### Configuring Kratos

Create a Jsonnet claims mapper as described in
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx).
Save the code in
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.microsoft.jsonnet`.

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.microsoft.jsonnet"
local claims = std.extVar('claims');
{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // If connecting only to your organization (one tenant), claims.email is safe to use if you have not actively disabled e-mail verification during signup.
      //
      // The email might be empty if the account is not linked to an email address.
      // For a human readable identifier, consider using the "preferred_username" claim.
      [if "email" in claims then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Enable the Microsoft provider in the ORY Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: microsoft # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: microsoft
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the Application ID from the App Registration
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the generated Secret value from the App Registration
            tenant: .... # Replace this with the Tenant of your choice (see below)
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.microsoft.jsonnet
            scope:
              - profile
              - email
```

Azure AD is now an option to log in to kratos.

##### Choosing Tenant

There are two ways to use the `microsoft` provider for authentication:

1. For authenticating users in a single Azure AD Directory (organisation), set
   the `tenant` value to either the `Directory ID` from the "App Registration"
   page, or the organisation domain. E.g. `8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490`
   or `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.
2. For authenticating any user in the Microsoft identity platform, set the
   `tenant` value to either:
   - `organizations` to allow users with work or school accounts, or
   - `consumers` to allow users with personal accounts, or
   - `common` to allow both kind of accounts.

## Twitch

To set up "Sign in with Twitch" you must create a
[Twitch OAuth2 Application](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication#registration).

Set the "Redirect URI" to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/twitch
```

The pattern of this URL is:

```
http(s)://<domain-of-ory-kratos>:<public-port>/self-service/methods/oidc/callback/<provider-id>
```

The provider ID must point to the provider's ID set in the ORY Kratos
configuration file (explained in further detail at
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx)).

As explained in
[OpenID Connect and OAuth2 Credentials](../concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2.mdx),
you must also create a Jsonnet code snippet for the provider. Save the code in
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.twitch.jsonnet`.

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.twitch.jsonnet"
local claims = {
  email_verified: false
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by Twitch.
      [if "email" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email,
    },
  },
}
```

Now, enable the Twitch provider in the ORY Kratos config located at
`<kratos-directory>/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml`.

```yaml title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/.kratos.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  methods:
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      config:
        providers:
          - id: twitch # this is `<provider-id>` in the Authorization callback URL. DO NOT CHANGE IT ONCE SET!
            provider: generic
            client_id: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client ID provided by Twitch
            client_secret: .... # Replace this with the OAuth2 Client Secret provided by Twitch
            issuer_url: https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2
            mapper_url: file:///etc/config/kratos/oidc.twitch.jsonnet
            scope:
              - openid
              - user:read:email # required for email and email_verified claims in the near future
            requested_claims: # explicitly request email and email_verified claims because twitch doesn't add them by default
              id_token:
                email:
                  essential: true
                email_verified:
                  essential: true
```

Next, open the login endpoint of the SecureApp and you should see the Twitch
Login option!

## Google, LinkedIn, Facebook

Connecting with other Social Sign In providers will be very similar to the
GitHub flow. If you've managed to do it, add to this document by writing it down
and making a PR! :)
