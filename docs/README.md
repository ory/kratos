# Documentation

This directory contains the project's documentation.

## Develop

To change the documentation locally, you need NodeJS installed. Next, install
the dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

### Develop

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.
