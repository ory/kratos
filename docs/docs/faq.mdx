  #kratos #database <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: We want to seperate our customers and employees, so we
    store them in different databases. But we would like to have them use the
    same login dialog for our portal. How can I achieve that with Ory Kratos?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: You can deploy Ory Kratos two times, and use the same
    login/registration endpoints if you like. You may need to tell you
    login/registration ui which Kratos it is supposed to talk to.

  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: What is the correct flow to sanitize the username and
    make sure it satisfies a specific regex (e.g. only alphanumeric characters)?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: In the identity json schema using
    https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions.
    To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or
    GitHub you write jsonnet code: https://jsonnet.org.

<Question tags="question_src-theme- kratos_src-theme- traits_src-theme- KYC_src-theme-">
  #kratos #traits #KYC <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Some of our identity traits fields may be the subject to
    identity validation (know your customer, KYC). Once they are validated we do
    not allow the identity to be edited by the end-user. Is there anything in
    the roadmap to support this scenario?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: There is an open issue for this feature:
    https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47.

    <strong>Q</strong>: Are there plans to provide hooks on
    registration/login/logouts/identity updates?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Yes! Check these issues for more information on the
    current progress: https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/271 and

  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: How can I verify beforehand if a username is available
    during registration?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: You can't right now. It would allow account enumeration
    attacks.

<Question tags="question_src-theme- kratos_src-theme- database_src-theme- migration_src-theme-">
  #kratos #database #migration <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Do have plans to support user migration scenarios
    similar to auth0 automatic migrations? E.g. configure a callback to the
    legacy system when you cannot find the corresponding user, and store the
    identity on successful legacy system response.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: No plans yet, but migration is an important piece of the
    puzzle. We will probably focus on importing existing users first though. An
    alternative to callback and custom code is probably fronting the legacy
    system with ORY Hydra (OAuth2/OIDC Server) and then using that as an
    upstream in ORY Kratos.

  #kratos #security #attack <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: Do you have protection or plans for brute force attacks
    i.e. repetitive login attempts? Leaked database scans?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: See the following document:{' '}

  #kratos #oidc <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: How do I append a random suffix e.g. a number to OIDC
    usernames if the username returned by a provider is already taken.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Not sure if jsonnet has a rand function built into the
    stdlib, but it does have the md5 function. You can probably use that.

<Question tags="question_src-theme- kratos_src-theme- spa_src-theme-">
  #kratos #spa <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: I want to implement a single-page-app (SPA). Can i do
    that with kratos?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Yes, definitely. We don't have an example-app, though.
    Also you might not come around some page-reloads as you definitely should
    avoid the API-flows and use the browser-flows instead. So hopefully you're
    not too strict with your SPA.{' '}

<Question tags="question_src-theme- kratos_src-theme- traits_src-theme-">
  #kratos #traits <br />
  <p>
    <strong>Q</strong>: I want read-only or hidden user-specific data. Can't i
    use traits for that?
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A</strong>: Traits are currently visible to the user and also
    editable by him. Although it make sense to have read-only and/or hidden
    traits for users, we can't give any timing when such features will be
    available. <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47">Issue</a>
