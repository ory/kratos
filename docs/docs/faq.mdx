<Question tags={["kratos","database"]}>
    #kratos #database <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: We want to seperate our customers and employees, so we store them in different databases. But we would like to have them use the same login dialog for our portal. How can I achieve that with Ory Kratos?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: You can deploy Ory Kratos two times, and use the same login/registration endpoints if you like. You may need to tell you login/registration ui which Kratos it is supposed to talk to.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","user","validation","traits"]}>
    #kratos #user #validation #traits <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: What is the correct flow to sanitize the username and make sure it satisfies a specific regex (e.g. only alphanumeric characters)?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: In the identity json schema using https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/string.html#regular-expressions. To sanitize usernames coming from third-party OIDC providers like Google or GitHub you write jsonnet code: https://jsonnet.org.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","traits","KYC"]}>
    #kratos #traits #KYC <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: Some of our identity traits fields may be the subject to identity validation (know your customer, KYC). Once they are validated we do not allow the identity to be edited by the end-user. Is there anything in the roadmap to support this scenario?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: There is an open issue for this feature: https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","hooks"]}>
    #kratos #hooks <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: Are there plans to provide hooks on registration/login/logouts/identity updates?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: Yes! Check these issues for more information on the current progress: https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/271 and https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/30.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["registration","kratos","traits"]}>
    #registration #kratos #traits <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: How can I verify beforehand if a username is available during registration?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: You can't right now. It would allow account enumeration attacks.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","database","migration"]}>
    #kratos #database #migration <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: Do have plans to support user migration scenarios similar to auth0 automatic migrations? E.g. configure a callback to the legacy system when you cannot find the corresponding user, and store the identity on successful legacy system response.</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: No plans yet, but migration is an important piece of the puzzle. We will probably focus on importing existing users first though. An alternative to callback and custom code is probably fronting the legacy system with ORY Hydra (OAuth2/OIDC Server) and then using that as an upstream in ORY Kratos.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","security","attack"]}>
    #kratos #security #attack <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: Do you have protection or plans for brute force attacks i.e. repetitive login attempts? Leaked database scans?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: See the following document: <a href="https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/security#passwords">Ory Kratos Security Measures</a></p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","oidc"]}>
    #kratos #oidc <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: How do I append a random suffix e.g. a number to OIDC usernames if the username returned by a provider is already taken.</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: Not sure if jsonnet has a rand function built into the stdlib, but it does have the md5 function. You can probably use that.</p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","spa"]}>
    #kratos #spa <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: I want to implement a single-page-app (SPA). Can i do that with kratos?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, definitely. We don't have an example-app, though. Also you might not come around some page-reloads as you definitely should avoid the API-flows and use the browser-flows instead. So hopefully you're not too strict with your SPA. <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/668">Issue</a></p>
</Question>

<br/><Question tags={["kratos","traits"]}>
    #kratos #traits <br/>
    <p><strong>Q</strong>: I want read-only or hidden user-specific data. Can't i use traits for that?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: Traits are currently visible to the user and also editable by him. Although it make sense to have read-only and/or hidden traits for users, we can't give any timing when such features will be available. <a href="https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/47">Issue</a></p>
