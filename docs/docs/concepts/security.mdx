title: Threat Models and Security Profiles

:::warning

Please be aware that this chapter is still work in progress. Not all mitigation
strategies have been implemented yet in ORY Kratos!

:::

Running any software that stores personal information exposes the
developer/company to risks. Analyzing which threat agents pose a risk,
understanding the possible motivations for an attack, or why an agent is a
threat, knowing the attack surface, the likelihood, and the impact are important
all aspects of a threat model.

This documentation can not substitute a thorough and serious threat model, yet
it will provide some guidelines to help configure ORY Kratos in a way that makes
it best suited for any risk assessment.

## Account Enumeration Attacks

:::warning

This feature is a work in progress and is tracked as
[kratos#133](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/133).

It does not yet work as documented!

Considering the above, an example would be for example an adult website. A
threat agent wants to blackmail a well known politician by checking if someone
can sign up at that website using the `well-known-politician@email.com` email.

If the service responds with
`Sorry, that email is already signed up here. Did you try to log in instead?`,
the agent is able to proceed with some type of blackmail scheme.

[OWASP defines several Black-Box tests](<https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_User_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account_(OWASP-AT-002)#Black_Box_testing_and_example>)
that cover Account Enumeration Scenarios.

This attack usually makes only sense if an email address or a phone number is
collected during registration. For chosen usernames, this attack is much more
difficult, as the attacker has to know what usernames the victim is using.

There are three common ways an attacker can figure out if a user is signed up at
a service:

- During login: "No user with this email address was found"
- During registration or email update: "A user with this email address exists
  already"
- During password reset: "No user with this email address was found"

To mitigate this attack, the following methods need to be deployed:

- The login form should return the same message regardless of whether the
  password is wrong or the email/username does not exist: "The provided
  credentials are invalid."
- The password reset form should always return a success message and send out an
  email. If the email address is registered, a normal password reset email is
  sent. If the email address is not registered, an email is sent to the address
  indicating that no account is set up with that email address. This is helpful
  to users that have multiple email addresses and are using the wrong email
  address for the password reset.
- The registration form should also always return a success message and send out
  an email. If the email address is not yet registered, a regular "account
  activation" email is sent out. If the email address is registered already, a
  email is sent out telling the user that the account is already set up, and
  link to the login screen.

:::important

If you wish to mitigate account enumeration attacks, it is important to note
that you cannot sign in users directly after sign up! Depending on the type of
service you provide, you might not care about this specific attack in which case
direct login after sign up would be ok.

:::

### Hash Timing Attack Mitigation

A timing attack against password hashing looks as follows:

1. Login to an existing account and measure time which takes, depending on the
   hashing configuration, between 200ms and 2s;0
2. Try out other accounts (e.g. `alice@example.org`). If the account does not
   exist, password hashing does not run, hence it takes much less time for the
   server to answer (< 100ms).

To protect against this attack, Ory Kratos adds a configurable delay with
standard deviation to login flows where the account does not exist.

### Enabling Account Enumeration Defenses

Assuming you wish to enable account enumeration defenses, you need to configure
ORY Kratos as follows:

- Collect one or more email addresses during sign up and enable email
  verification.
- **Do not** enable the `session` post-registration workflow.

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    verification:
      enabled: true
```

#### Defending Against Account Enumeration when using OpenID Connect

Scenario: In some cases you might want to use the email address returned by e.g.
the GitHub profile to be added to your identity's account. You might also want
to use it as an email + password identifier so that the identity is able to log
in with a password as well. An attacker is able to exploit that by creating a
social profile on another site (e.g. Google) and use the victims email address
to set it up (this only works when the victim does not yet have an account with
that email at Google). The attacker can then use that "spoofed" social profile
to try and sign up with your ORY Kratos installation. Because the victim's email
address is already known to ORY Kratos, the attacker might be able to observe
the behavior (e.g. seeing an error page) and come to the conclusion that the
victim already has an account at the website.

Mitigation: This attack surface is rather small and requires a lot of effort,
including forging an e.g. Google profile, and can fail at several stages. To
completely mitigate any chance of that happening, only accept email addresses
that are marked as verified in your Jsonnet code:

```json title="contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/oidc.github.jsonnet"
local claims = {
  email_verified: false
} + std.extVar('claims');

{
  identity: {
    traits: {
      // Allowing unverified email addresses enables account
      // enumeration attacks, especially if the value is used for
      // e.g. verification or as a password login identifier.
      //
      // Therefore we only return the email if it (a) exists and (b) is marked verified
      // by GitHub.
      [if "email_primary" in claims && claims.email_verified then "email" else null]: claims.email_primary,
    },
  },
}
```

### Disabling Account Enumeration Defenses

Enforcing email verification, which requires an email round trip and disrupts
the sign up process, is not always feasible. In these cases, you might want to
disable account enumeration defenses.

If you enable the `session` post-registration workflow - signing the user in
directly after registration - disables account enumeration defenses:

```yaml
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        password:
          - hook: session
```

## Account Takeover Defenses

The Settings Flow implements account takeover defenses as it is not possible to
change the password without knowing the existing password. A good example of
this flow is the
[GitHub sudo mode](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/sudo-mode).

## Passwords

Password-based authentication flows are subject to frequent abuse through

- Social Engineering Attacks;
- Password Guessing Attacks;
- Phishing Attacks.

Further improvements are work in progress and are tracked on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Amodule%3Ass%2Fpassword+)

### Expensive Hashing with Argon2

ORY Kratos uses Argon2 for password hashing. Argon2 is the official winner of
the PHC 2017. You can tweak the Argon2 configuration in your ORY Kratos
configuration file:

```yaml
hashers:
  argon2:
    memory: 128MB
    iterations: 2
    parallelism: 4
    salt_length: 16
    key_length: 32
```

To determine the ideal parameters, head over to the
[setup guide](../../guides/setting-up-password-hashing-parameters).

### Password Policy

To prevent weak passwords ORY Kratos implements different measures. Users often
choose passwords similar to their traits. To prevent this ORY Kratos ensures
there is a sufficient
[Levenshtein-Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) (aka
"Edit-Distance") between the identifier and the password. It also makes sure
that the identifier and password have a small enough longest common substring.

Furthermore the `password` method comes with a build-in check against the
["Have I been pwned"](https://haveibeenpwned.com) breach database. This way ORY
Kratos makes sure your users cannot use passwords like "password", "123456" or
any other commonly used one. To protect the value of the password the
[range API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3#SearchingPwnedPasswordsByRange) is
being used.

#### Password Policy Best Practices

Almost every service with a login offers some type of registration using a
password. Therefore, there are many strategies floating around, with many of
them implementing terrible and insecure patterns such as:

- Not allowing special characters in passwords.
- Not allowing the use of password managers by disabling the "paste"
  functionality in password fields.
- Requiring you to rotate your password every month (passwords expire).
- ...

Troy Hunt has written an
[excellent piece on password policies](https://www.troyhunt.com/passwords-evolved-authentication-guidance-for-the-modern-era/)
and why they recently changed and how.

ORY Kratos implements a password policy that:

- Checks if a password has previously been leaked using the
  [HIBP API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2),
- Checks if a password is too similar to one of the identifiers (in a future
  release [kratos#184](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/184)),
- Makes passwords not expire.

This is a rundown of all the practices ORY Kratos implements and why. **Some
things need to be implemented by yourself** as they must be implemented in the
User Interface that interfaces with ORY Kratos. You can find these in section
[User Interface Guidelines](#user-interface-guidelines).

##### Password Complexity

This outline and quotes are defined in the
[NIST Digital Identity Guidelines - 5.1.1.2 Memorized Secret Verifiers](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html).
ORY Kratos, unless explicitly advertised, implements these guidelines and best
practices.

Passwords must have a minimum length of 8 characters and all characters
(unicode, ASCII) must be allowed:

> Verifiers SHALL require subscriber-chosen memorized secrets to be at least 8
> characters in length. Verifiers SHOULD permit subscriber-chosen memorized
> secrets at least 64 characters in length. All printing ASCII [RFC 20]
> characters as well as the space character SHOULD be acceptable in memorized
> secrets. Unicode [ISO/ISC 10646] characters SHOULD be accepted as well. To
> make allowances for likely mistyping, verifiers MAY replace multiple
> consecutive space characters with a single space character prior to
> verification, provided that the result is at least 8 characters in length.
> Truncation of the secret SHALL NOT be performed. For purposes of the above
> length requirements, each Unicode code point SHALL be counted as a single
> character.

Passwords must be checked against a database of compromised secrets such as
[Have I Been Pwnd](https://haveibeenpwned.com):

> When processing requests to establish and change memorized secrets, verifiers
> SHALL compare the prospective secrets against a list that contains values
> known to be commonly-used, expected, or compromised. For example, the list MAY
> include, but is not limited to:
>
> - Passwords obtained from previous breach corpuses.
> - Dictionary words.
> - Repetitive or sequential characters (e.g. ‘aaaaaa’, ‘1234abcd’).
> - Context-specific words, such as the name of the service, the username, and
>   derivatives thereof.
>
> If the chosen secret is found in the list, the CSP or verifier SHALL advise
> the subscriber that they need to select a different secret, SHALL provide the
> reason for rejection, and SHALL require the subscriber to choose a different
> value.

Show the user a password-strength meter (to be implemented, see
[#136](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/136)):

> Verifiers SHOULD offer guidance to the subscriber, such as a password-strength
> meter [Meters], to assist the user in choosing a strong memorized secret. This
> is particularly important following the rejection of a memorized secret on the
> above list as it discourages trivial modification of listed (and likely very
> weak) memorized secrets

Do not require mixtures of characters types or prohibiting repeated characters:

> Verifiers SHOULD NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures
> of different character types or prohibiting consecutively repeated characters)
> for memorized secrets. Verifiers SHOULD NOT require memorized secrets to be
> changed arbitrarily (e.g., periodically). However, verifiers SHALL force a
> change if there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.

##### User Interface Guidelines

These best practices need to be implemented in your User Interface and can not
be handled by ORY Kratos. All ORY-built reference and demo applications
implement these best practices:

Allow pasting of passwords:

> Verifiers SHOULD permit claimants to use “paste” functionality when entering a
> memorized secret. This facilitates the use of password managers, which are
> widely used and in many cases increase the likelihood that users will choose
> stronger memorized secrets.

Allow the user to show the secret in the UI:

> In order to assist the claimant in successfully entering a memorized secret,
> the verifier SHOULD offer an option to display the secret — rather than a
> series of dots or asterisks — until it is entered. This allows the claimant to
> verify their entry if they are in a location where their screen is unlikely to
> be observed. The verifier MAY also permit the user’s device to display
> individual entered characters for a short time after each character is typed
> to verify correct entry. This is particularly applicable on mobile devices.

##### Password Hints

> Memorized secret verifiers SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a “hint”
> that is accessible to an unauthenticated claimant.
>
> [NIST Digital Identity Guidelines - 5.1.1.2 Memorized Secret Verifiers](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html)

##### Password Expiry

> Forcing password expiry carries no real benefits because:
>
> - the user is likely to choose new passwords that are only minor variations of
>   the old
> - stolen passwords are generally exploited immediately
> - resetting the password gives you no information about whether a compromise
>   has occurred
> - an attacker with access to the account will probably also receive the
>   request to reset the password
> - if compromised via insecure storage, the attacker will be able to find the
>   new password in the same place

## Anti-Automation

:::warning

This feature is a work in progress and is tracked as
[kratos#133](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/138).

:::

Actions that cause out-of-band communications, such as sending an activation
link via email or an activation code via SMS, can be abused by automated
systems. The goal of such an attack is to send out so many emails or SMS, that
your reputation worsens (spam filters) or you're faced with massive costs
(carrier fees).

CAPTCHA renders these attacks either very difficult or impossible. ORY Kratos
has CAPTCHA support built-in. ORY Kratos will prompt the user to complete a
CAPTCHA in the following scenarios:

- The user tries to register more than one account within 72 hours.
- The user failed provide valid credentials for the third time within 12 hours.
- The user tries to recover their account for the second time within 72 hours.

For integration guidelines, please check the individual flow's (registration,
login, account recovery) integration documentation.

## Digital Identity Guidelines

There is no one standard to digital identity. ORY Kratos closely follows
emerging frameworks and guidelines such as:
[Digital Identity Guidelines established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)
(and a follow-up [FAQ](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/)) .

As ORY Kratos grows, this document will continue to expand and add sections
covering individual security recommendations established by NIST.
