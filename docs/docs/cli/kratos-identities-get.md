## kratos identities get

Get one or more identities by ID

### Synopsis

This command gets all the details about an identity. To get an identity by some
selector, e.g. the recovery email address, use the list command in combination
with jq.

We have to admit, this is not easy if you don&#39;t speak jq fluently. What
about opening an issue and telling us what predefined selectors you want to
have? https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/new/choose

```
kratos identities get &lt;id-0 [id-1 ...]&gt; [flags]
```

### Examples

```
To get the identities with the recovery email address at the domain &#34;ory.sh&#34;, run:

	$ kratos identities get $(kratos identities list --format json | jq -r &#39;map(select(.recovery_addresses[].value | endswith(&#34;@ory.sh&#34;))) | .[].id&#39;)
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                              help for get
  -i, --include-credentials stringArray   Include third party tokens (only &#34;oidc&#34; supported)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands
