:::info

Please read the [Self-Service Flows](../../self-service.mdx) overview before
continuing with this document.

:::

Account Recovery must be performed if access to an account needs to be
recovered. Common use cases include:

- "Forgot password" flows
- "Lost MFA device" flows
- ...

There are two Recovery Flow types supported in Ory Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser and the application is
  - a server-side application (e.g. NodeJS, Java, ...)
  - a client-side application (e.g. ReactJS, AngularJS, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

The Recovery Flow can be summarized as the following state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: User Interface renders Recovery Flow Forms
  s3: Update Recovery Flow with Error Context(s)
  s4: Recovery challenge initiated (e.g. link via email)
  s5: Recovery completed, user logged in
  [*] --> s1 : User clicks "Recover Account"
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> s4 : User provides valid recovery data
  s2 --> s3 : User provides invalid recovery data
  s3 --> s2
  s4 --> s5 : Challenge response valid
  s4 --> s3 : Challenge response invalid
  s5 --> [*]
`}
/>

<Tabs
  defaultValue="oss"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud', value: 'oc'},
    {label: 'Ory Kratos', value: 'oss'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="oc">

Account recovery can be configured in the "Customize/Account Recovery" screen of
Ory Cloud.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss">

    You can configure which methods to use in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    link:
      enabled: true
      config:
        # Defines how long a recovery link is valid for (default 1h)
        lifespan: 15m

        # If the link should point to a domain (and path) that differs from the configured public base URL,
        # set this value to the base URL you want:
        base_url: https://my-example-domain.com

  flows:
    recovery:
      enabled: true

      # Defines how long a recovery flow (the UI interaction, not the link!)
      # is valid for (default 1h)
      lifespan: 15m
      # ...
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Methods

Currently, one recovery method is supported:

- The `link` method performs account recovery (also known as password reset) by
  sending an email containing a recovery link to the user.

### Recovery `link` Method

There are two email types sent by this method:

<p>
  <figure>
    <img
      alt="Recovery email sent to unknown address"
      src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/mailslurper-recovery-unknown.png')}
    />
    <figcaption>
      If the requested email address is an unknown recovery address, an account
      recovery attempt email is sent to that email address.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
  <figure>
    <img
      alt="Recovery email sent to a known recovery address"
      src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/mailslurper-recovery-known.png')}
    />
    <figcaption>
      If the requested email address is a known recovery address, a recovery
      link is sent to that email address.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[brilliant blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

The emails are using templates that can be customised as explained in
[Customizing E-Mail Templates](../../concepts/email-sms.md#templates). The
template IDs are:

- Unknown email address: `recovery_invalid`
- Known email address: `recovery_valid`

You should also configure how long a session is privileged. The user will only
be able to update his/her password (or any other credential) for the specified
amount of time after clicking on the recovery link.

:::note

If the email address used for recovery purposes is the same as the email used
for verification purposes and the account has not yet been activated (see
[Account Activation](verify-email-account-activation.mdx) - that is, if the
email address is not yet verified, the verification status of the corresponding
object in Kratos will be set to verified upon successful flow finalization.

:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="oss"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud Platform', value: 'ocp'},
    {label: 'Ory Kratos', value: 'oss'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ocp">

Configuring the privileged session duration will be possible in the future.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss">

You can configure the privileged session duration in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      privileged_session_max_age: 15m
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To specify that an identity's trait is a recovery email, use the following
Identity Schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "recovery": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

## Initialize Recovery Flow

<DomainWarning />

The first step is to initialize the Recovery Flow. This sets up Anti-CSRF tokens
and more. Each recovery flow has a `state` parameter which follows the state
machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
	[*] --> choose_method
	choose_method --> sent_email
	sent_email --> sent_email
	note right of sent_email
	    The user may fill out the email form input again as a way to re-send the email.
	end note
	sent_email --> passed_challenge
	passed_challenge --> [*]
`}
/>

where

- `choose_method` indicates that the user has not chosen a recovery method yet.
  This is useful when `link` is not the only recovery method active.
- `sent_email` implies that the recovery email has been sent out.
- `passed_challenge` is set when the user has clicked the recovery link and
  completed the account recovery.

### Recovery for Server-Side Browser Clients

The Recovery Flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between Ory
Kratos, your Recovery UI, and the end-user's browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={['recovery']}
  success="Set session cookie and initialize Settings Flow"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the Recovery Flow, point the Browser to the initialization
endpoint:

```shell-session
$ curl -s -i -X GET \
    -H "Accept: text/html" \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/browser

HTTP/2 302
date: Fri, 09 Jul 2021 12:50:38 GMT
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
content-length: 120
location: https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/hosted/recovery?flow=33964b22-c364-4217-b6fc-5f381d142d65
cache-control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
set-cookie: aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5Z3JvdW5kLnByb2plY3RzLm9yeWFwaXMuY29tL2FwaS9rcmF0b3MvcHVibGlj_csrf_token=WCOWjhwHy338874TGz6S7ICVp/hFFVHV8Ev7e1hZYSo=; Path=/api/kratos/public; Domain=playground.projects.oryapis.com; Max-Age=31536000; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=None
vary: Origin
vary: Cookie
strict-transport-security: max-age=15724800; includeSubDomains

<a href="https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/hosted/recovery?flow=33964b22-c364-4217-b6fc-5f381d142d65">Found</a>.
```

The server responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the Recovery UI, appending the
`?flow=<flow-id>` query parameter (see the curl example) to the URL configured
here:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="oss"
  values={[
    {label: 'Ory Cloud Platform', value: 'ocp'},
    {label: 'Ory Kratos', value: 'oss'}
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="ocp">

The Ory Cloud Platform offers a default UI implementation. Pointing to another
UI endpoint will be supported in the future.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oss">

You can configure which recovery URL to use in the Ory Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    recovery:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Recovery for Client-Side (AJAX) Browser Clients

The Recovery Flow for client-side browser clients relies on AJAX requests.

<AjaxWarning />

<SelfServiceSpaFlow
  flows={['recovery']}
  success="Set session cookie and initialize Settings Flow"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the Recovery Flow, call the recovery initialization endpoint and
set `Accept: application/json`:

```
$ curl -v -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json"  \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/browser | jq

> GET /api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/browser HTTP/2
> Host: playground.projects.oryapis.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: application/json

< HTTP/2 200
< date: Fri, 09 Jul 2021 09:36:34 GMT
< content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8
< content-length: 1241

}
```

### Recovery for API Clients and Clients without Browsers

<ApiWarning />

The Recovery Flow for API clients does not use HTTP Redirects and can be
summarized as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow
  flows={['recovery']}
  success="Return session token"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the API flow, the client calls the API-flow initialization
endpoint
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#initialize-recovery-flow-for-api-clients))
which returns a JSON response:

```shell-session
$ curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json"  \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/api | jq

{
  "id": "660cc928-48f1-485b-8003-dc690f5afc35",
  "type": "api",
  "expires_at": "2021-07-09T13:52:56.270081773Z",
  "issued_at": "2021-07-09T12:52:56.270081773Z",
  "request_url": "http://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/api",
  "ui": {
    "action": "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery?flow=660cc928-48f1-485b-8003-dc690f5afc35",
    "method": "POST",
    "nodes": [ /* */ ]
  },
  "state": "choose_method"
}
```

## Recovery Flow Payloads

Fetching the Recovery Flow
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#get-recovery-flow)) is usually
only required for browser clients but also works for Recovery Flows initialized
by API clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

```shell-session
$ flowId=$(curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/api | jq -r '.id')

$ curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/flows?id=$flowId" | jq

{
  "id": "7c033350-a935-4807-a06e-85cfc2475c75",
  "type": "api",
  "expires_at": "2021-07-09T14:00:52.752217Z",
  "issued_at": "2021-07-09T13:00:52.752217Z",
  "request_url": "http://playground.projects.oryapis.com/self-service/recovery/api",
  "active": "default",
  "ui": {
    "action": "https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery?flow=7c033350-a935-4807-a06e-85cfc2475c75",
    "method": "POST",
    "nodes": [ /* ... */ ]
  },
  "state": "choose_method"
}
```

### Send Recovery Link to Email

:::note

The `link` recovery mode will always open a link in the browser, even if it was
initiated by an API client. This is because the user clicks the link in his/her
email client, which opens the browser.

:::

When the `link` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload in
the Recovery Flow:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
    'https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/api/kratos/public/self-service/recovery/flows?id=199a2c74-08ca-4f22-b24c-3de3032682f8' | \
      jq -r '.ui.nodes[] | select(.group=="link")'

{
  "type": "input",
  "group": "link",
  "attributes": {
    "name": "email",
    "type": "email",
    "required": true,
    "disabled": false
  },
  "messages": null,
  "meta": {}
}
{
  "type": "input",
  "group": "link",
  "attributes": {
    "name": "method",
    "type": "submit",
    "value": "link",
    "disabled": false
  },
  "messages": null,
  "meta": {
    "label": {
      "id": 1070005,
      "text": "Submit",
      "type": "info"
    }
  }
}
```

## Recovery Form Validation

The form payloads are then submitted to Ory Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 302 Found redirect pointing to the Registration UI for Browser
  Clients;
- An `application/json` response for API Clients and Client-Side Browser
  applications (e.g. Single Page Apps).

### Recovery Link via Email

To send the recovery email, the end-user fills out the form. There might be
validation errors such as a malformed email:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkWithErrors} />

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 302 Found redirect
to the Recovery Flow UI, containing the Recovery Flow ID which includes the
error payloads.

For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the
Recovery Flow in the response payload as JSON.

#### Successful Submission

On successful submission, an email will be sent to the provided address:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkSuccess} />

## Unsuccessful Recovery

If the recovery challenge (e.g. the link in the recovery email) is invalid or
expired, the user will be HTTP 302 redirected to the Recovery UI.

:::note

When an invalid or expired challenge is used, Ory Kratos initializes a new
Account Recovery flow automatically. This flow will always be a Browser-based
flow because the challenge is completed by clicking a link!

:::

The new Recovery Flow includes an error message such as the following:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkInvalidChallenge} />

Please keep in mind that this part of the flow always involves a Browser!

## Successful Recovery

Completing account recovery always results in a HTTP 302 redirect with a Ory
Kratos Login Session Cookie to the Settings UI with a Settings Flow prompting
the user to update their password or credentials:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkChallengeDone} />

## Code Examples for NodeJS, ReactJS, Go, ...

The Recovery User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application
(server, native app, single page app) that should render a recovery form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, Ory Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Recovery Flow JSON response to render the recovery form UI,
which could looks as follows depending on your programming language and web
framework:

<RenderFlow flow="recovery" />
