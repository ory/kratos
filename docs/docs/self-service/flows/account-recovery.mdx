Account Recovery must be performed if access to an account needs to be
recovered. Common use cases include:

- "Forgot password" flows
- "Lost MFA device" flows
- ...

## Forgot Password

The forgot password flow is a work in progress and will be implemented in a
future release of ORY Kratos.

## Questions

> One option is to allow the user to self-construct their own questions. The problem with this though is that you end up with either painfully obvious questions:
>
> - **What colour is the sky?**
> - **How do you spell “password”?**
>
> Questions which can put people in an uncomfortable position when a human uses the secret question for verification (such as in a call centre):
>
> **Who did I sleep with at the Christmas party?**
>
> When it comes to secret questions, people need to be saved from themselves! In other words, the site itself should
define the secret question, or rather define a series of secret questions from which the user can choose.
And not just choose one either; ideally, the user should define two or more secret questions at the time of account
registration which can then be used as a second channel of identity verification. Having multiple questions adds
a higher degree of confidence to the verification process plus gives you opportunity to add randomness (not always
show the same question) plus provides a bit of redundancy should someone legitimate forget an answer.

> So what makes a good secret question? There are a few different factors:
>
> * It should be concise – the question is to the point and unambiguous
> * The answer is specific – you don’t want a question which could be answered in different ways by the same person
> * The possible answers must be diverse – a question about someone’s favourite colour would result in a small subset of possible answers
> * Answer discovery should be hard – if you can readily find the answer for anyone (think high-profile people) then it’s no good
> * The answer must be constant over time – asking for someone’s favourite movie may result in a different answer a year from now

Here are some good examples:

- What was the first concert you ever went to and where? (e.g. "Pink Floyd at Gotham City Stadium")
