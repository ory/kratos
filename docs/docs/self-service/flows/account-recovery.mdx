:::information

Please read the [Self-Service Flows](../../self-service) overview before
continuing with this document.

:::

Account Recovery must be performed if access to an account needs to be
recovered. Common use cases include:

- "Forgot password" flows
- "Lost MFA device" flows
- ...

There are two Recovery Flow types supported in ORY Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

The Recovery Flow can be summarized as the following state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: User Interface renders Recovery Flow Forms
  s3: Update Recovery Flow with Error Context(s)
  s4: Recovery challenge initiated (e.g. link via email)
  s5: Recovery completed, user logged in
  [*] --> s1 : User clicks "Recover Account"
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> s4 : User provides valid recovery data
  s2 --> s3 : User provides invalid recovery data
  s3 --> s2
  s4 --> s5 : Challenge response valid
  s4 --> s3 : Challenge response invalid
  s5 --> [*]
`}
/>

To enable recovery flows, make the following adjustments to your ORY Kratos
configuration:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    link:
      enabled: true
  flows:
    recovery:
      enabled: true
```

## Methods

Currently, one recovery method is supported:

- The `link` method performs account recovery (also known as password reset) by
sending an email containing a recovery link to the user.

### Recovery `link` Method

The `link` method is dis/enabled in the ORY Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    link:
      enabled: true
      # ...
```

There are two email types sent by this method:

<p>
  <figure>
    <img
      alt="Recovery email sent to unknown address"
      src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/mailslurper-recovery-unknown.png')}
    />
    <figcaption>
      If the requested email address is a known recovery address, a recovery
      link is sent to that email address.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

<p>
  <figure>
    <img
      alt="Recovery email sent to unknown address"
      src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/mailslurper-recovery-unknown.png')}
    />
    <figcaption>
      If the requested email address is a known recovery address, a recovery
      link is sent to that email address.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>

This prevents account enumeration attacks as explained in this
[brilliant blog post by Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/website-enumeration-insanity-how-our-personal-data-is-leaked/).

The emails are using templates that can be customised as explained in
[Customizing E-Mail Templates](../../concepts/email-sms#templates). The
template IDs are:

- Unknown email address: `recovery_invalid`
- Known email address: `recovery_valid`

You should also configure how long a session is privileged. The user will only
be able to update his/her password (or any other credential) for the specified
amount of time after clicking on the recovery link:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      privileged_session_max_age: 15m
```

To specify that an identity's trait is a recovery email, use the following Identity JSON Schema:

```diff
 {
   "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
   "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
   "title": "Person",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
     "traits": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "email": {
           "type": "string",
           "format": "email",
           "ory.sh/kratos": {
             "credentials": {
               "password": {
                 "identifier": true
               }
             },
+            "recovery": {
+              "via": "email"
+            }
           }
         }
       }
       "additionalProperties": false
     }
   }
 }
```

## Initialize Recovery Flow

The first step is to initialize the Recovery Flow. This sets up Anti-CSRF tokens and more.
Each recovery flow has a `state` parameter which follows the state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram-v2
	[*] --> choose_method
	choose_method --> sent_email
	sent_email --> sent_email
	note right of sent_email
	    The user may fill out the email form input again as a way to re-send the email.
	end note
	sent_email --> passed_challenge
	passed_challenge --> [*]
`}
/>

where

- `choose_method` indicates that the user has not chosen a recovery method yet.
  This is useful when `link` is not the only recovery method active.
- `sent_email` implies that the recovery email has been sent out.
- `passwed_challenge` is set when the user has clicked the recovery link and
  completed the account recovery.

### Recovery for Browser Clients

The Recovery Flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between ORY Kratos, your Recovery UI, and the end-user's
browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={['recovery']}
  success="Set session cookie"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the Recovery Flow, point the Browser to
[the initialization endpoint](../../self-service#initialization-and-redirect-to-ui):

<CodeTabs items={initBrowserFlow} />

The server responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the Recovery UI, appending the `?flow=<flow-id>` query
parameter (see the curl example) to the URL configured here:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    recovery:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/recovery?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/recovery
```

### Recovery for API Clients

<ApiWarning />

The Recovery Flow for API clients does not use HTTP Redirects and can be summarized as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow
  flows={['recovery']}
  success="Return session token"
  interactions={['"Recover account"']}
/>

To initialize the API flow ([REST API Reference](../reference/api#getSelfServiceRecoveryFlow)), the client [calls the API-flow initialization endpoint](../../self-service#initialization)
which returns a JSON response:

<CodeTabs items={initApiFlow} />

## Recovery Flow Payloads

Fetching the Recovery Flow ([REST API Reference](../reference/api#get-recovery-flow)) is usually only required for browser clients but also works
for Recovery Flows initializied by API clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

<CodeTabs items={getFlow} />

### Send Recovery Link to Email

When the `link` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload in the Recovery Flow:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
    'http://127.0.0.1:4434/self-service/recovery/flows?id=2183a80c-a190-4fde-95bd-a15aa3103930' | jq -r '.methods.link.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/recovery/methods/link?flow=2183a80c-a190-4fde-95bd-a15aa3103930",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "PsERHvmk+4Ouq3wjMAaLsATrAk7sydJjkSbZFVynvwCJRZRtOTkosFHJQy5p5fFiBv6KnxwP2oSXUvE8J5w9Lw=="
    },
    {
      "name": "email",
      "type": "email",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Recovery Flow Form Rendering

The Recovery User Interface is a route (page / site) in your
application (server, native app, single page app) that should render
a recovery form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Recovery Flow JSON response to render the recovery form UI,
which could looks as follows depending on your
programming language and web framework:

<RenderFlow flow="recovery" />

## Recovery Form Validation

The form payloads are then submitted to ORY Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 302 Found redirect pointing to the Recovery UI for Browser Clients.
- An `application/json` response for API Clients.

### Recovery Link via Email

To send the recovery email, the end-user fills out the form. There might be validation
errors such as a malformed email:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkWithErrors} />

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the
Recovery Flow UI, containing the Recovery Flow ID which includes the error payloads.

For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the
Recovery Flow in the response payload as JSON.

#### Successful Submission

On successful submission, an email will be sent to the provided address:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkSuccess} />

## Unsuccessful Recovery

If the recovery challenge (e.g. the link in the recovery email)
is invalid or expired, the user will be HTTP 302 redirected to the
Recovery UI.

:::note

When an invalid or expired challenge is used, ORY Kratos initializes a new
Account Recovery flow automatically. This flow will always be a Browser-based
flow because the challenge is completed by clicking a link!

:::

The new Recovery Flow includes an error message such as the following:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkInvalidChallenge} />

Please keep in mind that this part of the flow always involves a Browser!

## Successful Recovery

Completing account recovery always results in a HTTP 302 redirect
with a ORY Kratos Login Session Cookie to the Settings UI with a
Settings Flow prompting the user to update their password or credentials:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodLinkChallengeDone} />
