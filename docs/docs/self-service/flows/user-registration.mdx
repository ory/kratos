:::information

Please read the [Self-Service Flows](../../self-service) overview before
continuing with this document.

:::

There are two registration flow types supported in ORY Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

The registration flow can be summarized as the following state machine:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: Execute Before Registration Hook(s)
  s3: User Interface renders Registration Flow Forms
  s4: Execute After Registration Hook(s)
  s5: Update Registration Flow with Error Context(s)
  s6: Registration successful
	[*] --> s1 : User clicks "Sign up"
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> Error : A hook fails
  s2 --> s3
  s3 --> s4 : User provides valid registration data
  s3 --> s5 : User provides invalid registration data
  s5 --> s3
  s4 --> Error : A hook fails
  s4 --> s6
  s6 --> [*]
  Error --> [*]
`}
/>

Currently, two registration methods are supported:

- `password` for signing up with an email / username and password;
- `oidc` for signing up using a social sign in provider such as Google or Facebook.

Both are dis/enabled in the ORY Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
    oidc:
      enabled: true
      # ...
```

## Initialize Registration Flow

The first step is to initialize the registration flow. This allows pre-registration hooks to run, set up Anti-CSRF tokens,
and more.

### Registration for Browser Clients

The registration flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between ORY Kratos, your Registration UI, and the end-user's
browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={['registration']}
  success="Create user"
  interactions={['"Sign up"']}
/>

To initialize the Registration flow, point the Browser to
[the initialization endpoint](../../self-service#initialization-and-redirect-to-ui):

<CodeTabs items={initBrowserFlow} />

The server responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the Registration UI, appending the `?flow=<flow-id>` query
paremeter (see the curl example) to the URL configured here:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/registration?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url:  http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/registration
```

### Registration for API Clients

<ApiWarning />

The registration flow for API clients does not use HTTP Redirects and can be summarized as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow
  flows={['registration']}
  success="Return registration session token"
  interactions={['"Sign in"']}
/>

To initialize the API flow ([REST API Reference](../reference/api#getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow)), the client [calls the API-flow initialization endpoint](../../self-service#initialization)
which returns a JSON response:

<CodeTabs items={initApiFlow} />

## Registration Form Payloads

Fetching the registration flow ([REST API Reference](../reference/api#get-registration-flow)) is usually only required for browser clients but also works
for registration flows initializied by API clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

<CodeTabs items={getFlow} />

### Registration with Username/Email and password

:::tip Before you start

Please read the
[Username / Email & Password Credentials Documentation](../../concepts/credentials/username-email-password) first.

:::

When the `password` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload in the Registration Flow.

ORY Kratos uses the Identity JSON Schema defined in
`identity.default_schema_url` to generate a list of form fields and add it to
the Registration Flow.

Assuming we are using the Identity JSON Schema from the Quickstart

<CodeFromRemote
  link="https://github.com/ory/kratos/blob/master/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/identity.traits.schema.json"
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/kratos/master/contrib/quickstart/kratos/email-password/identity.traits.schema.json"
/>

the response would look as such:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/registration/flows?id=838895fb-bb05-4075-8a7e-1cd22ca42017' | jq

            "type": "text"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Registration with Google, GitHub, ..., OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

:::tip Before you start

Check out the
[Sign in with GitHub, Google, ... Guide](../../guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin.mdx) and learn how
to set up this method!

:::

The Social Sign Up Method (`oidc`) enables you to use

- [GitHub](http://github.com/);
- [Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/);
- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in);
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/);
- [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra);
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org);
- and every other OpenID Connect Certified Provider

:::warning

Social Sign Up is currently not possible for API Clients. It will be possible in
a future version, which is partially tracked as
[kratos#273](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/273)

:::

If enabled, the method contains an `oidc` key with the
configured sign in providers as submit fields:

```shell script
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" -s \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/registration/flows?id=838895fb-bb05-4075-8a7e-1cd22ca42017' | jq

          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Registration Flow Form Rendering

The Registration User Interface is a route (page / site) in your
application (server, native app, single page app) that should render
a registration form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Registration Flow JSON response to render the registration form UI,
which could looks as follows depending on your
programming language and web framework:

<RenderFlow flow="registration" />

## Registration Form Validation

The form payloads are then submitted to ORY Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 302 Found redirect pointing to the Registration UI for Browser Clients.
- An `application/json` response for API Clients.

### Registration with Username/Email and Password

To complete the registration process, the end-user fills out the form which
must include a field marked as the identifier (`ory.sh/kratos.credentials.password.identifier: true`) in the Identity JSON Schema, for
example:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "email"
      ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

If the registration payload is invalid (e.g. the password does
not match the password policy, the email is missing, ...), the
password method includes the validation errors:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodPasswordWithErrors} />

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Registration Flow UI, containing the Registration Flow ID which includes the error payloads.

For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad Request and the Registration Flow in the response payload as JSON.

### Registration with Google, GitHub, ..., OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

Completing the `oidc` method requires the user to go through an OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect flow which
involves logging into the upstream identity provider (e.g. Google) and giving consent.

:::note

If the user has already sign up with the given provider before, the user will simply be logged in
and no new ORY Kratos Identity will be created.

:::

A possible validation error is a missing ID Token:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodOidcWithErrors} />

What may also happen is that the ORY Kratos Identity Schema JSON includes a field which is required but
was not provided by the upstream identity provider (e.g. Google). In those cases, the end-user's browser
is returned to the registration screen with the form validation errors.

Let's assume the ORY Kratos Identity Schema JSON requires a `website` trait

```
{
  "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            }
          }
        },
        "website": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "email",
        "website"
      ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

which was not provided by the upstream identity provider. This can happen when the user refuses to accept a
certain scope (e.g. "Allow ORY Kratos access to my website") or if the provider simply does not have this data (e.g. the upstream
identity provider does not collect the user's website).

In that case the end-user ends up at the registration screen and is prompted to provide the missing or invalid fields:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodOidcWithCompletion} />

## Successful Registration

Completing the registration behaves differently for Browser and API Clients. The registration flow
does not issue a ORY Kratos Login Session automatically which prevents Account Enumeration Attacks.
If these types of attacks are not your concern, you can add the session hook which will issue
a session after successful registration:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
# $ kratos -c path/to/my/kratos/config.yml serve
selfservice:
  flows:
    registration:
      after:
        password:
          hooks:
            - hook: session
        oidc:
          hooks:
            - hook: session # Always enable this for oidc flows or the user experience suffers significantly!
```

:::important

It is very important to add the "session" hook to the after `oidc` registration
hooks. Otherwise your users need to use the login flow again to be able to get a
session. Account Enumeration Attacks with OpenID Connect sign in flows are
typically not an issue if you follow the guidelines in the
[Sign in with GitHub, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Microsoft ... Guide](../../guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin)!

:::

### Browser Clients

When the registration is completed successfully, ORY Kratos responds with a HTTP 302 Redirect to the
[configured redirect URL](../../concepts/browser-redirect-flow-completion).

#### With Auto-Login on Registration

If the `session` after hook is enabled, a `Set-Cookie` HTTP Header is set alongside the HTTP 302 redirect
which contains the ORY Kratos Login Session Cookie:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Cache-Control: 0
Location: http://127.0.0.1:4455/
Set-Cookie: csrf_token=b8OebRPTPr5ow23mA5gIZmFNLeuMbv8pZz1jT1Ex7ys=; Path=/; Domain=127.0.0.1; Max-Age=31536000; HttpOnly
Set-Cookie: ory_kratos_session=MTU5OTE2ODc2N3xEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR055VlROMGRteHhSakJrUzBkbmRUUjBlVFY1V0RCRWFVTnJXVmR6V25oaHx2DICsB6IMbaHSQwnYITUZqr7Qx7CxUlnaneJWH495wQ==; Path=/; Expires=Fri, 04 Sep 2020 21:32:47 GMT; Max-Age=86400; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax
Vary: Cookie
Date: Thu, 03 Sep 2020 21:32:47 GMT
Content-Length: 0
```

Now, whenever the browser is making a request (with cookies) to the `http://127.0.0.1/sessions/whoami` endpoint,
the session will be returned:

```shell script
curl -s -H "Cookie: ory_kratos_session=MTU5OTE2ODc2N3xEdi1CQkFFQ180SUFBUkFCRUFBQVJfLUNBQUVHYzNSeWFXNW5EQThBRFhObGMzTnBiMjVmZEc5clpXNEdjM1J5YVc1bkRDSUFJR055VlROMGRteHhSakJrUzBkbmRUUjBlVFY1V0RCRWFVTnJXVmR6V25oaHx2DICsB6IMbaHSQwnYITUZqr7Qx7CxUlnaneJWH495wQ==" \

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### API Clients

For API Clients, ORY Kratos responds with a JSON payload which includes the identity which
just authenticated, the session, and the ORY Kratos Session Token:

```shell script
# Inits a registration flow
$ actionUrl=$(\
  curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/registration/api" \

        "via": "email"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### With Auto-Login on Registration

If the `session` after hook is enabled, the ORY Kratos Login Session and ORY Kratos Login Session Token
are included in the response:

```shell script

## Hooks

ORY Kratos allows you to configure hooks that run before and after a Registration Flow.
This may be helpful if you'd like to restrict registration to IPs coming from your internal network or other logic.

For more information about hooks please read the [Hook Documentation](../hooks).
