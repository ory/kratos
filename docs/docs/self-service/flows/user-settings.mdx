:::info

Please read the [Self-Service Flows](../../self-service.mdx) overview before
continuing with this document.

:::

ORY Kratos allows users to update their own settings and profile information
using two principal flows:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

The Settings Flow is composed of several high-level steps summarized in this
state diagram:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  s1: Flow is initialized
  s2: Execute Before Settings Hook(s)
  s3: User Interface renders Settings Flow Forms
  s4: Check if privileged fields were updated
  s8: Ask user to sign in again/confirm with password
  s7: Execute After Settings Hook(s)
  s5: Update Settings Flow with error context(s)
  s6: Settings update successful
	[*] --> s1 : User clicks "Save changes"
  s1 --> s2
  s2 --> Error : A hook fails
  s2 --> s3

  s4 --> s8: yes
  s4 -->s7: no
  s8--> s7: Authentication successful
  s7 --> s6
  s6 --> [*]
  Error --> [*]
`}
/>

Currently, three settings methods are supported:

- `password` for updating the password used to sign in;
- `oidc` for un-/linking from social sign in providers such as Google or
  Facebook;
- `profile` for updating an identity's traits (e.g. change the first name). The
  updated traits must be valid against the Identity JSON Schema defined for its
  [Identity Traits](../../concepts/identity-data-model.md).

These methods are dis/enabled in the ORY Kratos config:

```yaml title="path/to/my/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
    oidc:
      enabled: true
    profile:
      enabled: true
```

### Updating Privileged Fields

Most Settings Flow Methods allow the user to update fields which are considered
protected:

- The `password` method allows updating the password, which is a protected
  field;
- The `profile` method allows updating protected fields such as
  - the username or email address used to sign in;
  - the recovery email address;
- The `oidc` method allows linking and unlinking from Google, Facebook, Github,
  ... which is considered a privileged action (check out the
  [set up guide](../../guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin.mdx)).

If any of these fields are changed, the ORY Kratos Login Session must not be
older than the configured `privileged_session_max_age` value:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      # Sessions older than a minute requires the user to sign in again before
      # the password is changed.
      privileged_session_max_age: 1m
```

If the ORY Kratos Login Session is older than the specified amount, the user is
prompted to re-authenticate similar to the
[GitHub sudo mode](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/sudo-mode):

<video controls width="100%">
  <source src={privilegedVideo.webm} type="video/webm" />
  <source src={privilegedVideo.mp4} type="video/mp4" />
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
</video>

This end-user experience currently works only for Browser-based Settings Flows.
API-based flows will simply return a 403 Forbidden status message which require
you to request a new ORY Kratos Login session using the
[API-based Login Flow](user-login.mdx).

## Initialize Settings Flow

The first step is to initialize the settings flow. This allows pre-settings
hooks to run, set up Anti-CSRF tokens, and more. Each Settings Flow also has a
`state` field which can either be `success` or `show_form`:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  [*] --> show_form
  show_form --> show_form : Form payload is not valid
  show_form --> success : Form payload is valid
  success --> [*]
`}
/>

Keep in mind that initializing a Settings Flow requires a valid ORY Kratos Login
Session Token (for API-based flows) or ORY Kratos Login Session Cookie (for
Browser-based flows)!

Before we start with the examples below, let's create a user using the API-based
Registration Flow. This will yield a session token which then use to perform the
Settings Flow on this page:

```shell script
username=foo-user@ory.sh
password=sBdHzGp9hAx2Hf2m

actionUrl=$(curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/registration/api' | jq -r '.methods.password.config.action')

session=$(curl -s  -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{ "traits.email": "'$username'", "password": "'$password'" }' \
  "$actionUrl")

sessionToken=$(echo $session | jq -r '.session_token')
echo $sessionToken
```

### Profile Updates for Browser Clients

The settings flow for browser clients relies on HTTP redirects between ORY
Kratos, your Settings UI, and the end-user's browser:

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow
  flows={['settings']}
  success="Identity Updated and HTTP 302 redirect to Success Flow"
  interactions={['"Save Profile Changes"']}
/>

To initialize the Settings Flow, point the Browser to
[the initialization endpoint](../../self-service#initialization-and-redirect-to-ui):

<CodeTabs items={initBrowserFlow} />

The server responds with a HTTP 302 redirect to the Settings UI, appending the
`?flow=<flow-id>` query paremeter (see the curl example) to the URL configured
here:

```yaml title="path/to/config/kratos.yml"
selfservice:
  flows:
    settings:
      # becomes http://127.0.0.1:4455/settings?flow=df607aa1-d555-4b2a-b3e4-0f5a1d2fe6f3
      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/settings
```

### Settings for API Clients

<ApiWarning />

The Settings Flow for API clients does not use HTTP Redirects and can be
summarized as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow
  flows={['settings']}
  success="Identity Updated and HTTP 200 OK"
  interactions={['"Save Profile Changes"']}
/>

To initialize the API flow, the client calls the API-flow initialization
endpoint
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#initialize-settings-flow-for-api-clients))
which returns a JSON response:

<CodeTabs items={initApiFlow} />

## Settings Flow Payloads

Fetching the Settings Flow
([REST API Reference](../../reference/api.mdx#get-settings-flow)) is usually
only required for browser clients but also works for Settings Flows initializied
by API clients. All you need is a valid flow ID:

<CodeTabs items={getFlow} />

### Update Profile

When the `profile` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload
in the Settings Flow:

```shell script
curl -s -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $sessionToken"  \
  -H "Accept: application/json"  \
  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/api | jq -r '.methods.profile.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/methods/profile?flow=572148bf-4774-4a0d-9e7e-881d920a1600",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "P9Wg2GLCfJqfx+o9zmaxVVs1Y/Q0f6BdkbTCJTrgpttMz4+jFDpBluBHPfWsK1GKrwmiWEgDgPnHjB1DjjbFkQ=="
    },
    {
      "name": "traits.email",
      "type": "text",
      "value": "api@user.org"
    },
    {
      "name": "traits.name.first",
      "type": "text",
      "value": "API"
    },
    {
      "name": "traits.name.last",
      "type": "text",
      "value": "User"
    }
  ]
}
```

The form fields depend on the
[Identity's Schema JSON](../../concepts/identity-user-model).

### Update Password

:::tip Before you start

Please read the
[Username / Email & Password Credentials Documentation](../../concepts/credentials/username-email-password)
first.

:::

When the `password` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload
in the Settings Flow:

```shell script
$ curl -s -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $sessionToken"  \
  -H "Accept: application/json"  \
  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/api | jq -r '.methods.password.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/methods/password?flow=653b0f9c-eab3-47da-b956-d2f495dde5b2",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "password",
      "type": "password",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "bQmJ5wzYW5Qio0um7TxAirwt30SG1y/ahy8z6DjaBCBCv3PZ4HbvBBB9zypIUHA0p8Z0FFWQ8XPvy0cb3csJyQ=="
    }
  ]
}
```

### Link and Unlink from Google, Facebook, GitHub, ..., OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

:::tip Before you start

Check out the
[Sign in with GitHub, Google, ... Guide](../../guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin.mdx)
and learn how to set up this method!

:::

When the `oidc` method is enabled, it will be part of the `methods` payload in
the Settings Flow:

```shell script
curl -s -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $sessionToken"  \
  -H "Accept: application/json"  \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/flows?id=938da8c6-e98d-4381-87a5-b9265b1854eb' | jq -r '.methods.oidc.config'

{
  "action": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/methods/oidc/settings/connections?flow=938da8c6-e98d-4381-87a5-b9265b1854eb",
  "method": "POST",
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "csrf_token",
      "type": "hidden",
      "required": true,
      "value": "Fj7nOKsFQtBXywzKiPaZzYUL+x6XHMU3HFL2/go94YxjnYm/UGofxKoXJX5JJ0FTJ/e04GqVfxpkJ1jCc8DF5A=="
    },
    {
      "name": "link",
      "type": "submit",
      "value": "github"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::warning

Social Sign In is currently not possible for API Clients. It will be possible in
a future version, which is partially tracked as
[kratos#273](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/273)

:::

## Settings Flow Form Rendering

The Settings User Interface is a route (page / site) in your application
(server, native app, single page app) that should render a settings form.

In stark contrast to other Identity Systems, ORY Kratos does not render this
HTML. Instead, you need to implement the HTML code in your application (e.g.
NodeJS + ExpressJS, Java, PHP, ReactJS, ...), which gives you extreme
flexibility and customizability in your user interface flows and designs.

You will use the Settings Flow JSON response to render the settings form UI,
which could looks as follows depending on your programming language and web
framework:

<RenderFlow flow="settings" />

## Settings Form Validation

The form payloads are then submitted to ORY Kratos which follows up with:

- An HTTP 302 Found redirect pointing to the Settings UI for Browser Clients.
- An `application/json` response for API Clients.

When validation errors happen, browser clients receive a HTTP 302 Found redirect
to the Settings Flow UI, containing the Settings Flow ID which includes the
error payloads. For API Clients, the server typically responds with HTTP 400 Bad
Request `application/json` and the Settings Flow in the response payload as
JSON.

### Update Profile

To complete the profile update, the end-user fills out the presented profile
form (e.g. updates their first name or email address). Possible validation
errors include JSON Schema validation errors (e.g. `"format": "email"` not
respected):

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodProfileWithErrors} />

### Update Password

To change the password, the end-user fills out the presented form and provides a
new password. Possible validation errors include not providing the password or
providing a password which does not match the password policy:

<CodeTabs items={getFlowMethodPasswordWithErrors} />

### Un-/Linking from/with Google, Facebook, GitHub, ..., OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0

To link or unlink from an OpenID Connect or OAuth2 provider such as Google,
GitHub, Facebook, the user either clicks the unlink or link button depending on
the interaction.

There are no expected validation errors except for an error where the profile
(e.g. Google) to be linked is already linked with another identity in the
system. This will currently result in a system error but will be a validation
error in the future (tracked as
[kratos#694](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/694)).

## Successful Settings Update

Completing the settings update behaves differently for Browser and API Clients.

### Browser Clients

When the profile update is completed successfully, ORY Kratos responds with a
HTTP 302 Redirect to the Settings UI which now contains the success state
(`state: success`) as well as the udpated identity:

```shell script
$ curl -s -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $sessionToken"  \
  -H "Accept: application/json"  \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/flows?id=2c0e9349-3ddc-4f17-9f8e-6a6e37989c91' | jq

{
  "id": "2c0e9349-3ddc-4f17-9f8e-6a6e37989c91",
  "type": "browser",
  "expires_at": "2020-09-08T13:21:58.8900756Z",
  "issued_at": "2020-09-08T12:21:58.8900756Z",
  "request_url": "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/browser",
  "methods": {
    // ...
  },
  "identity": {
    "id": "c4d50e89-4206-45e7-be94-7896f5b1c735",
    "schema_id": "default",
    "schema_url": "",
    "traits": {
      "name": {
        "last": "User",
        "first": "Foo"
      },
      "email": "foo-user-new@ory.sh"
    }
  },
  "state": "success"
}
```

You may also
[configure a redirect URL](../../concepts/browser-redirect-flow-completion)
instead which would send the end-user to that configured URL.

### API Clients

For API Clients, ORY Kratos responds with a JSON payload which includes the
updated identity:

```shell script
$ password=ByS8NWuFSkDgMjbe

$ actionUrl=$(curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: bearer $sessionToken" \
  'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/settings/api' | jq -r '.methods.password.config.action')

$ curl -s -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: bearer $sessionToken" \
    -d '{"password": "'$password'"}' \
    "$actionUrl" | jq

    "traits": {
      "email": "foo-user@ory.sh"
    },
    "verifiable_addresses": [
      {

        "value": "foo-user-@ory.sh",
        "via": "email"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Hooks

ORY Kratos allows you to configure hooks that run before and after a profile
update was successful. For more information about hooks please read the
[Hook Documentation](../hooks.mdx).
