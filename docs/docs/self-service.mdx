ORY Kratos implements flows that users perform themselves as opposed to
administrative intervention. Facebook and Google both provide self-service
registration and profile management features as you are able to make changes to
your profile and sign up yourself.

Most believe that user management systems are easy to implement because picking
the right password hashing algorithm and sending an account verification code is
a solvable challenge. The real complexity however hides in the details and
attack vectors of self-service flows. Most data leaks happen because someone is
able to exploit

- registration: with attack vectors such as account enumeration (), ...;
- login: phishing, account enumeration, leaked password databases, brute-force,
  ...;
- user settings: account enumeration, account takeover, ...;
- account recovery: social engineering attacks, account takeover, spoofing, and
  so on.

ORY Kratos applies best practices established by experts (National Institute of
Sciences NIST, Internet Engineering Task Force IETF, Microsoft Research, Google
Research, Troy Hunt, ...) and implements the following flows:

- [Login and Registration](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration.mdx)
- [Logout](self-service/flows/user-logout.md)
- [User Settings](self-service/flows/user-settings.mdx)
- [Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery.mdx)
- [Address Verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation.mdx)
- [User-Facing Error](self-service/flows/user-facing-errors.md)
- [2FA / MFA](self-service/flows/2fa-mfa-multi-factor-authentication.md)

Some flows break down into strategies which implement some of the flow's
business logic:

- The `password` strategy implement the
  [login and registration flow (with email/username and password)](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration/username-email-password.mdx),
  account recovery flow ("reset your password"), and
  [user settings flow ("change your password")](self-service/flows/user-settings/change-password.mdx).
- The `oidc` (OpenID Connect, OAuth2, Social Sign In) strategy implements
  [login and registration flow ("Sign in with ...")](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration/openid-connect-social-sign-in-oauth2.mdx),
  and
  [user settings flow ("un/link another social account")](self-service/flows/user-settings/link-unlink-openid-connect-oauth2.mdx).
- The `profile` strategy implements the
  [settings flow ("update your profile", "change your first/last name, ...")](self-service/flows/user-settings/user-profile-management.mdx).

Some flows additionally implement the ability
[to run hooks](self-service/hooks/index.mdx) which allow users to be immediately
signed in after registration, notify another system on successful registration
(e.g. Mailchimp), and so on.

## Network Flows for Browsers

All Self-Service Flows such as
[User Login](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration.mdx),
[User Registration](self-service/flows/user-login-user-registration.mdx),
[Profile Management](self-service/flows/user-settings.mdx) use the same
template:

1. The Browser makes an HTTP request to the flow's initialization endpoint (e.g.
   `/auth/browser/login`);
2. The initialization endpoint processes data and associates it with a request
   ID and redirects the browser to the flow's configured UI URL (e.g.
   `selfservice.flows.login.ui_url`), appending the request ID as the `request` URL Query
   Parameter;
3. The endpoint responsible for the UI URL uses the `request` URL Query
   Parameter (e.g. `http://my-app/auth/login?request=abcde`) to fetch the data
   previously associated with the Request ID from either ORY Kratos's Public or
   Admin API.
4. The UI endpoint renders the fetched data in any way it sees it fit. The flow
   is typically completed by the browser making another request to one of ORY
   Kratos' endpoints, which is usually described in the fetched request data.
