title: Self-Service Flows
sidebar_label: Concepts and Overview
---

Ory Kratos implements flows that users perform themselves as opposed to
administrative intervention. Facebook and Google both provide self-service
registration and profile management features as you are able to make changes to
your profile and sign up yourself.

import ApiWarning from '@theme/ApiWarning'
import CodeTabs from '@theme/Code/CodeTabs'
import {
  initApiFlow,
  initSpaFlow,
  initBrowserFlow
} from './self-service/flows/code/login'
import SelfServiceBrowserFlow from '@theme/SelfServiceBrowserFlow'
import SelfServiceApiFlow from '@theme/SelfServiceApiFlow'
import SelfServiceSpaFlow from '@theme/SelfServiceSpaFlow'

Most believe that user management systems are easy to implement because picking
the right password hashing algorithm and sending an account verification code is
a solvable challenge. The real complexity however hides in the details and
attack vectors of self-service flows. Most data leaks happen because someone is
able to exploit

- registration: with attack vectors such as account enumeration (), ...;
- login: phishing, account enumeration, leaked password databases, brute-force,
  ...;
- user settings: account enumeration, account takeover, ...;
- account recovery: social engineering attacks, account takeover, spoofing, and
  so on.

There are also many other areas you need to think about, such as:

- Mobile, Smart TV, ... authentication
- Linking and unlinking social profiles (e.g. "Sign in with Google" or "Connect
  with Google") to existing accounts

Ory Kratos applies best practices established by experts (National Institute of
Sciences NIST, Internet Engineering Task Force IETF, Microsoft Research, Google
Research, Troy Hunt, ...) and implements the following flows:

- [Registration](self-service/flows/user-registration.mdx)
- [Login](self-service/flows/user-login.mdx)
- [Logout](self-service/flows/user-logout.md)
- [User Settings](self-service/flows/user-settings.mdx)
- [Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery.mdx)
- [Address Verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation.mdx)
- [User-Facing Error](self-service/flows/user-facing-errors.md)
- [2FA / MFA](self-service/flows/2fa-mfa-multi-factor-authentication.md)

Some flows break down into "flow methods" which implement some of the flow's
business logic:

- The `password` method implements the login and registration with "email or/and
  username and password" method, and "change your password" user settings
  method.
- The `oidc` (OpenID Connect, OAuth2, Social Sign In) method implements "Sign in
  with ..." login and registration method and "un/link another social account"
  user settings method.
- The `profile` method implements the "update your profile", "change your
  first/last name, ..." user settings method).
- The `link` method implements the "click this link to reset your password"
  account recovery method.

Some flows additionally implement the ability
[to run hooks](self-service/hooks.mdx) which allow users to be immediately
signed in after registration, notify another system on successful registration
(e.g. Mailchimp), and so on.

## Performing Login, Registration, Settings, ... Flows

There are two flow types supported in Ory Kratos:

- Flows where the user sits in front of the Browser (e.g. website, single page
  app, ...)
- Flows where API interaction is required (e.g. mobile app, Smart TV, ...)

All Self-Service Flows ([User Login](self-service/flows/user-login.mdx),
[User Registration](self-service/flows/user-registration.mdx),
[Profile Management](self-service/flows/user-settings.mdx),
[Account Recovery](self-service/flows/account-recovery.mdx),
[Email or Phone verification](self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation.mdx))
support these two flow types and use the same data models but do use different
API endpoints.

<ApiWarning />

## Browser Flows for Server-Side Apps: NodeJS, Java Server Pages, ...

Browser-based flows make use of three core HTTP technologies:

- HTTP Redirects
- HTTP POST (`application/x-www-urlencoded`) and REST GET requests.
- HTTP Cookies to prevent CSRF and Session Hijaking attack vectors.

The browser flow is the easiest and most secure to set up and integrated with.
Ory Kratos takes care of all required session and CSRF cookies and ensures that
all security requirements are fulfilled.

The browser flow has three stages:

- Initialization and redirect to UI;
- Form rendering;
- Form submission and payload validation.

:::note

The payloads, examples, ports, and IPs shown here are the ones used if you run
the [Quickstart](quickstart.mdx). If you have not checked it out yet, please do
so before reading this document.

:::

<SelfServiceBrowserFlow flows={['login', 'settings', '...']} />

### Initialization and Redirect to UI

First, the Browser opens the flow's initialization endpoint
(e.g.`/self-service/login/browser`, `/self-service/registration/browser`, ...):

<CodeTabs items={initBrowserFlow} />

The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the database.
The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about the flow
such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in with Google")
and their form data.

Once stored, the Browser is HTTP 302 redirected to the flow's configured UI URL
(e.g. `selfservice.flows.login.ui_url`), appending the flow ID as the `flow` URL
Query Parameter. Also included will be might be some cookies such as Anti-CSRF
cookies.

The response will look along the lines of:

```
$ curl -s -v -X GET \
  -H "Accept: text/html" \
  http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser

# Response Headers
< HTTP/1.1 302 Found
< Cache-Control: 0
< Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
< Location: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login?flow=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe

< Vary: Cookie
< Date: Mon, 17 Aug 2020 13:54:52 GMT
< Content-Length: 97
```

### Form Rendering

The Browser opens the URL (here
`http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login?flow=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe`)
which renders the HTML form which for example shows the "username and password"
field, the "Update your email address" field, or other flow forms. This HTML
form is rendered be the
[Self-Service UI](concepts/ui-user-interface.md#self-service-user-interface-ssui)
which you fully control.

The endpoint responsible for the UI URL uses the `flow` URL Query Parameter
(here `...?flow=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe`) to call the flow
information endpoint (e.g.
`http://127.0.0.1:4434/self-service/login/flows?id=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe`)
and fetch the flow data - so for example the login form and any validation
errors. This endpoint is available at both Ory Kratos's Public and Admin
Endpoints. For example, the Self-Service UI responsible for rendering the Login
HTML Form would make a request along the lines of:

```
# The endpoint uses Ory Kratos' REST API to fetch information about the request
$ curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4434/self-service/login/flows?id=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe" | jq
```

The result includes login methods, their fields, and additional information
about the flow:

          "disabled": false
        },
        "messages": null,
        "meta": {}

        "messages": null,
        "meta": {

            "text": "ID",
            "type": "info"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "input",
        "group": "password",
        "attributes": {
          "name": "password",
          "type": "password",
          "required": true,
          "disabled": false
        },
        "messages": null,
        "meta": {
          "label": {
            "id": 1070001,
            "text": "Password",
            "type": "info"
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "input",
        "group": "password",
        "attributes": {
          "name": "method",
          "type": "submit",
          "value": "password",
          "disabled": false
        },
        "messages": null,
        "meta": {
          "label": {
            "id": 1010001,
            "text": "Sign in",
            "type": "info",
            "context": {}
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "forced": false
}
```

For more details, check out the individual flow documentation.

The flow UI then renders the given methods. For the example above, a suitable
HTML Form would look along the lines of:

```html
<form
  action="http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login?flow=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe"
  method="POST"
>
  <input
    name="csrf_token"
    type="hidden"
    value="pUhD8lmSNNRnX/tuy6yAM317SfdiPOwetYUKnx23iTHnySErkBGJwaF1t3cEqNtxF3uC7W5A/dwP5l5VDYFRSA=="
  />
  <fieldset>
    <label>
      <input name="password_identifier" type="text" value="" placeholder="ID" />
      <span>ID</span>
    </label>
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <label>
      <input name="password" type="password" value="" placeholder="Password" />
      <span>Password</span>
    </label>
  </fieldset>
  <button name="method" type="submit" value="password">Sign in</button>
</form>
```

### Form Submission and Payload Validation

The user completes the flow by submitting the form. The form action always
points to Ory Kratos directly. The business logic for the flow method will then
validate the form payload and return to the UI URL on validation errors. The UI
then fetches the information about the flow again

```
# The endpoint uses Ory Kratos' REST API to fetch information about the request
$ curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/flows?id=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe" | jq
```

which now includes validation errors and other potential messages:

```json5
{
  id: 'f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe',
  type: 'browser',
  expires_at: '2021-04-28T09:00:57.10254633Z',
  issued_at: '2021-04-28T08:50:57.10254633Z',
  request_url: 'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser',
  ui: {
    action: 'http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login?flow=f6209031-38d5-48bc-b6a5-118e8a24d1fe',
    method: 'POST',
    nodes: [
      // ...
      {
        type: 'input',
        group: 'password',
        attributes: {
          name: 'password_identifier',
          type: 'text',
          value: '',
          required: true,
          disabled: false
        },
        messages: [
          {
            id: 4000001,
            text: 'length must be >= 1, but got 0',
            type: 'error'
          }
        ],
        meta: {
          label: {
            id: 1070004,
            text: 'ID',
            type: 'info'
          }
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'input',
        group: 'password',
        attributes: {
          name: 'password',
          type: 'password',
          required: true,
          disabled: false
        },
        messages: [
          {
            id: 4000001,
            text: 'length must be >= 1, but got 0',
            type: 'error'
          }
        ],
        meta: {
          label: {
            id: 1070001,
            text: 'Password',
            type: 'info'
          }
        }
      }
      // ...
    ]
  },
  forced: false
}
```

If a system error (e.g. broken configuration file) occurs, the browser is
redirected to the [Error UI](self-service/flows/user-facing-errors.md).

If the form payload is valid, the flow completes with a success. The result here
depends on the flow itself - the login flow for example redirects the user to a
specified redirect URL and sets a session cookie. The registration flow also
redirects to a specified redirect URL but only creates the user in the database
and might issue a session cookie if configured to do so.

## Browser Flows for Client-Side Apps: Single-Page-Apps, SPAs, ...

Browser-based flows also support Client Side applications such as
Single-Page-Apps (ReactJS, AngularJS, NextJS, ...) that use AJAX to perform
requests.

Ory Kratos identifies SPA requests by checking if the `Accept` HTTP Header is
set to `application/json`.

If it is, these flows act like an API flow and respond with JSON instead of HTTP
redirects while still setting and requiring the necessary cookies for CSRF,
sessions, and more:

- Initialization **without redirect** using an AJAX request;
- Form rendering using HTML;
- Form submission as `application/json` and payload validation.

The high-level sequence diagram for API flows looks as follows:

<SelfServiceSpaFlow />

### Initialization

The AJAX client (e.g. NextJS app) makes a request to the flow's initialization
endpoint (e.g.`/self-service/login/browser`,
`/self-service/registration/browser`, ...):

<CodeTabs items={initSpaFlow} />

The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the database.
The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about the flow
such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in with Google")
and their form data.

### Form Rendering & Form Submission

Form rendering and form submission work exactly the same way as the flows for
server-side browser apps, with the exception of not redirecting to the return
address but instead replying with a JSON payload.

## API Flows

<ApiWarning />

API flows have three stages:

- Initialization **without redirect**;
- Form rendering using e.g. native iOS, Android, ... components;
- Form submission as `application/json` and payload validation.

The high-level sequence diagram for API flows looks as follows:

<SelfServiceApiFlow />

### Initialization

The client (e.g. mobile application) makes a request to the flow's
initialization endpoint (e.g.`/self-service/login/api`,
`/self-service/registration/api`, ...):

<CodeTabs items={initApiFlow} />

The initialization endpoint creates a flow object and stores it in the database.
The flow object has an ID and contains additional information about the flow
such as the login methods (e.g. "username/password" and "Sign in with Google")
and their form data.

### Form Rendering

While the Browser flow redirects the client and uses cookies to protect against
CSRF and session hijacking attacks, the API flow answers with a fresh flow
formatted as `application/json` right away. The client would then use that
information to render the UI. In React Native, this may look like the following
snippet:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Text, TextInput, View } from 'react-native'
import { PublicApi, LoginFlow } from '@ory/kratos-client'

const kratos = new PublicApi('http://127.0.0.1:4455/.ory/kratos/public')

export default function Login () {
  const [flow, setFlow] = useState<LoginFlow | undefined>(undefined)

  useEffect(() => {
    kratos.initializeSelfServiceAPILoginFlow().then(({ data: flow }) => {
      setFlow(flow)
    })
  }, [])

  if (!flow) {
    return null
  }

  // This is a non-functional, code example. It is missing state management and so on.
  // The idea is to show how initializing such a flow would look like in an API scenario.
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Login</Text>

      {flow.ui.nodes.map((node) => {
        switch (node.type) {
          case 'input':
            return <TextInput value={node.attributes.value} /* placeholder, name, ... *//>
          default:
            // ...
        }
      })}
    </>
  )
}
```

If needed, the client can re-request the flow using the same HTTP Request as the
browser flow at the Public API endpoint:

```shell script
curl -s -X GET \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/flows?id=41ebf1e9-79f5-4b97-b643-04bfc405f8ad" | jq

{
  "id": "41ebf1e9-79f5-4b97-b643-04bfc405f8ad",
  "type": "api",
  # ...
```

### Form Submission and Payload Validation

The request is then completed by sending the form formatted as
`application/json` to the action endpoint

```shell
flow=$(curl -s -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" "http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/api")
actionUrl=$(echo $flow | jq -r '.ui.action')

echo $actionUrl
# http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login?flow=6394ffa4-235f-4c1a-a200-e62f89862015

curl -s -X POST -H  "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"password_identifier": "i-do-not-exist@user.org", "password": "the-wrong-password", "method": "password"}' \
    "$actionUrl" | jq
```

which in this case fails with a 400 Bad Request error and the following payload:

```json

  "id": "6394ffa4-235f-4c1a-a200-e62f89862015",
