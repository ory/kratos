title: Getting URLs and Cookies to Work on Multi-Domains

## Base URL

The public base URL (`serve.public.base_url`) is used to compute redirect URLs,
form action URLs, and more. If you host Ory Kratos on more than one domain you
might want to enable the domain aliasing feature. This allows to register
additional base URLs. On incoming HTTP Requests, Ory Kratos checks the HTTP
`Host` Header and compares that to the list of domain aliases.

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
serve:
  public:
    base_url: https://this-is-the-default/base-url
    domain_aliases:
      - match_domain: www.another-domain.com
        base_path: /kratos
        scheme: https
      - match_domain: that-domain.com
        base_path: /
        scheme: http
```

If a match is found, the value `serve.public.base_url` will be ignored and
instead the base URL is computed:

```
<config.protocol>://<request.host + request.port><config.base_path>
```

Values `<request.host>`, `<request.port>` are set by the incoming HTTP request
and `<config.base_path>`, `<config.protocol>`, by the config:

- Incoming request is to `https://www.another-domain.com:123/kratos/identities/`
  so the result is `https://www.another-domain.com:123/kratos`
- Incoming request is to `http://www.another-domain.com/kratos/sessions/` so the
  result is `http://www.another-domain.com/kratos`
- Incoming request is to `https://that-domain.com/identities/` so the result is
  `https://that-domain.com/identities`

## Cookies

Ory Kratos' browser features rely heavily on HTTP Cookies to mitigate common
attack vectors and make the integration as easy as possible to use. Therefore it
is important to know that

1. [HTTP Cookies ignore ports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1612177/are-http-cookies-port-specific),
   meaning the browser will send a cookie it received for
   `http://my-domain.com:1234` to `http://my-domain.com:4321` as well.
2. [Subdomains can set HTTP Cookies for parent domains](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain),
   meaning a HTTP Cookie specifying `domain=my-domain.com` will be allowed to
   set even if the URL is `http://sub.my-domain.com` or
   `http://sub.sub.my-domain.com`.

You can adjust the session cookie's domain using:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
session:
  cookie:
    domain: my-domain.com
    path: /
```

:::warn

Do not set the cookie domain when using multiple domain aliases as it enforces
the domain - breaking sessions on your alias domains.

:::

What **is not** currently possible is to set up Ory Kratos in a way where you
get session cookies running on two separate top level domains (e.g.
`my-domain.com` and `another-domain.com`). This is tracked as
[kratos#662](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/662).
