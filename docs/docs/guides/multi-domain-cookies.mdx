title: Advanced Base URL, CSRF & Session Cookie Settings

This document describes advanced strategies for multi-domain environments and
other scenarios.

## Base URL

The public base URL (`serve.public.base_url`) is used to compute redirect URLs,
form action URLs, and more.

## Cookies

Ory Kratos' browser features rely heavily on HTTP Cookies to mitigate common
attack vectors and make the integration as easy as possible to use. Therefore it
is important to know that

1. [HTTP Cookies ignore ports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1612177/are-http-cookies-port-specific),
   meaning the browser will send a cookie it received for
   `http://my-domain.com:1234` to `http://my-domain.com:4321` as well.
2. [Subdomains can set HTTP Cookies for parent domains](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18492576/share-cookie-between-subdomain-and-domain),
   meaning a HTTP Cookie specifying `domain=my-domain.com` will be allowed to
   set even if the URL is `http://sub.my-domain.com` or
   `http://sub.sub.my-domain.com`.

You can adjust the session cookie's domain using:

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml"
# Settings for both anti-CSRF and session cookies
cookies:
  domain: www.cookies.com
  path: /cookies
  same_site: Lax

session:
  cookie:
    # Overrides cookies.domain for session cookies
    domain: my-domain.com

    # Overrides cookies.path for session cookies
    path: /

    # Overrides cookies.samesite for session cookies
    same_site: Strict
```

What **is not** currently possible is to set up Ory Kratos in a way where you
get session cookies running on two separate top level domains (e.g.
`my-domain.com` and `another-domain.com`). This is tracked as
[kratos#662](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/662).
