title: Distributed Tracing
---

Configuring Distributed Tracing (DT) will enable you to obtain a visualization
of the call paths that take place in order to process a request made to Kratos.
It's yet another tool that you can use to aid you in profiling, debugging and
ultimately understanding your deployment of Kratos better. Kratos currently
supports the following tracing options:

- Tracing backend(s): Jaeger, Elastic APM, Datadog, Zipkin and Instana - _Note:
  adding support for other
  [opentracing compliant backends](https://opentracing.io/docs/supported-tracers)
  is planned. To aid in priority, please
  [create an issue](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues) with your feature
  request._
- Following existing traces: If you have deployed Kratos behind a proxy that has
  initiated a trace, Kratos will attempt to join that trace by examining the
  request headers for tracing context.

### What a Kratos trace includes

In DT speak, a trace is comprised of one or more spans which are logical units
of work. Each Kratos span is encapsulated with the following state:

- A name
- A start time
- A finish time
- A set of zero or more tags

Kratos currently creates the following spans:

- Top level span (_named after the request path_) for the requested endpoint.
  Span tags: - http method - http status code - error IFF status code >= 400
- Child span will be created if bcrypt (_e.g. when the token endpoint is
  called_) is called. Span tags: - bcrypt work factor
- All SQL database interactions. Spans/tags will vary depending on the database
  driver used.

This is still evolving and subject to change as tracing support continues to
expand in Kratos. If you see something that is missing/wrong, please create an
issue.
