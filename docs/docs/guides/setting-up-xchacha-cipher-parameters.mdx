title: Setting up XChaCha20 Poly1305 Cipher algorithm
---

Ory Kratos supports encryption and decryption only for oidc token for now. This
section explain how to use and configure Kratos for using XChaCha20 Poly1305
Cipher algorithm.

The algorithm and secrets key must be set in the configuration. These
[secrets key rotation](secret-key-rotation) must be set and be a string of 32
characters long.

```yaml title="path/to/kratos/config.yml
secrets:
  cipher:
    - 32-LONG-SECRET-NOT-SECURE-AT-ALL
ciphers:
  algorithm: xchacha20-poly1305
```
