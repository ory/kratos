title: Configuring The Password Policy
---

The password policy is a set of rules that define the password requirements for
Kratos identities. They can be changed by modifying the following configuration
parameters:

```yaml title=path/to/kratos/config.yml
selfservice:
  methods:
    password:
      enabled: true
      config:
        haveibeenpwned_enabled: true
        min_password_length: 8
        identifier_similarity_check_enabled: true
```

#### `haveibeenpwned_enabled`

If set to `true`, the password policy will check if the password has been found
in the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) database. The default
value is `true`.

#### `min_password_length`

The minimum length of the password. The default value is `8`, the minimum
allowed value is `6`.

#### `identifier_similarity_check_enabled`

If set to `true`, the password policy will check if the password is similar to
the user identifier. The default value is `true`.
