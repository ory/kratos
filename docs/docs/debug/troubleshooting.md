### How can I separate customers/employee data, but have them use the same login dialog?

> portal.

You can deploy Ory Kratos two times, and use the same login UI pointing to two
different Kratos login endpoints - `/login/customer` or `/login/employee`,
either by having two different login routes, or by adding some logic to your
login UI that reroutes customers to `/login/customer` and employees to
`/login/employee`. So you define the same login or registration UI URLs in both
of the Kratos configurations. You may need to tell your login/registration UI
which Kratos it is supposed to talk to. The instances are cheap to deploy and
the databases are completely isolated from each other. For example something
like `/login/customer` and `/login/employee`.

### How can I verify in advance if a username is available during registration?

You can not right now. It would allow account enumeration attacks. See also the
[section in the documentation](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/security/#account-enumeration).

### Do have plans to support automatic user migration scenarios?

An alternative to callback and custom code is fronting the legacy system with
Ory Hydra (OAuth2/OIDC Server) and then using that as an upstream in Ory Kratos.
