This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn\ncredentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user\nto sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.\n\nThis endpoint is useful for:\n\nAJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly!\nReverse proxies and API Gateways\nServer-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!\n\nThis endpoint authenticates users by checking:\n\nif the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie;\nif the `Authorization: bearer \u003cory-session-token\u003e` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token;\nif the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.\n\nIf none of these headers are set or the cookie or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.\n\nAs explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:\n\n`session_inactive`: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token).\n`session_aal2_required`: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.",
