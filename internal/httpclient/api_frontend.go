			CreateBrowserLoginFlow Create Login Flow for Browsers

			This endpoint initializes a browser-based user login flow. This endpoint will set the appropriate
		cookies and anti-CSRF measures required for browser-based flows.

		If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to
		`selfservice.flows.login.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If a valid user session
		exists already, the browser will be redirected to `urls.default_redirect_url` unless the query parameter
		`?refresh=true` was set.

		If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
		case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

		`session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
		`session_aal1_required`: Multi-factor auth (e.g. 2fa) was requested but the user has no session yet.
		`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
		`security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!

		The optional query parameter login_challenge is set when using Kratos with
		Hydra in an OAuth2 flow. See the oauth2_provider.url configuration
		option.

		This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for clients that do not have a browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...) as cookies are needed.

		More information can be found at [Ory Kratos User Login](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service/flows/user-login) and [User Registration Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/self-service/flows/user-registration).

			CreateBrowserSettingsFlow Create Settings Flow for Browsers

			This endpoint initializes a browser-based user settings flow. Once initialized, the browser will be redirected to
		`selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If no valid
		Ory Kratos Session Cookie is included in the request, a login flow will be initialized.

		If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to
		`selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If no valid user session
		was set, the browser will be redirected to the login endpoint.

		If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the settings flow without any redirects
		or a 401 forbidden error if no valid session was set.

		Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator
		Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
		credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
		to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.

		If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
		case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

			ToSession Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To

			Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated.
		Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent.
		When the request it successful it adds the user ID to the 'X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id' header
		in the response.

		If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:

		```js
		pseudo-code example
		router.get('/protected-endpoint', async function (req, res) {
		const session = await client.toSession(undefined, req.header('cookie'))

		console.log(session)
		})
		```

		When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:

		```js
		pseudo-code example
		...
		const session = await client.toSession("the-session-token")

		console.log(session)
		```

		When using a token template, the token is included in the `tokenized` field of the session.

		```js
		pseudo-code example
		...
		const session = await client.toSession("the-session-token", { tokenize_as: "example-jwt-template" })

		console.log(session.tokenized) // The JWT
		```

		Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator
		Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
		credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
		to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.

		This endpoint is useful for:

		AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly!
		Reverse proxies and API Gateways
		Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!

		This endpoint authenticates users by checking:

		if the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie;
		if the `Authorization: bearer <ory-session-token>` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token;
		if the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.

		If none of these headers are set or the cookie or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.

		As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:

		`session_inactive`: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token).
		`session_aal2_required`: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

			UpdateLoginFlow Submit a Login Flow

			Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint
		behaves differently for API and browser flows.

		API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and responds with
		HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success;
		HTTP 410 if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set and optionally a `use_flow_id` parameter in the body;
		HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

		Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
		a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the login succeeded;
		a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

		Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
		HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
		HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
		HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

		If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
		case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

		`session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
		`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
		`security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
		`browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
		Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

			UpdateRecoveryFlow Update Recovery Flow

			Use this endpoint to update a recovery flow. This endpoint
		behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

		`choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
		and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
		For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid.
		and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
		For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended.
		`sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` for the `link` method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It
		works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
		`passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a recovery link")
		does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL
		(if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with
		a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

			UpdateRegistrationFlow Update Registration Flow

			Use this endpoint to complete a registration flow by sending an identity's traits and password. This endpoint

		HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

		Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
		a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the registration succeeded;

			UpdateSettingsFlow Complete Settings Flow

			Use this endpoint to complete a settings flow by sending an identity's updated password. This endpoint
		behaves differently for API and browser flows.

		API-initiated flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
		HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success;
		HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;

		HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token.
		HTTP 403 when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.
		Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.

		Browser flows without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` respond with
		a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the flow succeeded;
		a HTTP 303 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.
		a HTTP 303 redirect to the login endpoint when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.

		to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.

		If this endpoint is called with a `Accept: application/json` HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
		case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

		`session_refresh_required`: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect

CreateBrowserSettingsFlow Create Settings Flow for Browsers

This endpoint initializes a browser-based user settings flow. Once initialized, the browser will be redirected to
`selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If no valid
Ory Kratos Session Cookie is included in the request, a login flow will be initialized.

If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to
`selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If no valid user session
was set, the browser will be redirected to the login endpoint.

If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the settings flow without any redirects
or a 401 forbidden error if no valid session was set.

Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator
Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.

If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
`session_inactive`: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first.
`security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!

CreateNativeLoginFlow Create Login Flow for Native Apps

This endpoint initiates a login flow for native apps that do not use a browser, such as mobile devices, smart TVs, and so on.

If a valid provided session cookie or session token is provided, a 400 Bad Request error
will be returned unless the URL query parameter `?refresh=true` is set.

To fetch an existing login flow call `/self-service/login/flows?flow=<flow_id>`.

You MUST NOT use this endpoint in client-side (Single Page Apps, ReactJS, AngularJS) nor server-side (Java Server
Pages, NodeJS, PHP, Golang, ...) browser applications. Using this endpoint in these applications will make
you vulnerable to a variety of CSRF attacks, including CSRF login attacks.

In the case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
`session_aal1_required`: Multi-factor auth (e.g. 2fa) was requested but the user has no session yet.
`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.

This endpoint MUST ONLY be used in scenarios such as native mobile apps (React Native, Objective C, Swift, Java, ...).

You must provide a valid Ory Kratos Session Token for this endpoint to respond with HTTP 200 OK.

To fetch an existing settings flow call `/self-service/settings/flows?flow=<flow_id>`.

You MUST NOT use this endpoint in client-side (Single Page Apps, ReactJS, AngularJS) nor server-side (Java Server
Pages, NodeJS, PHP, Golang, ...) browser applications. Using this endpoint in these applications will make
you vulnerable to a variety of CSRF attacks.

Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator
Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.

In the case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
`session_inactive`: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first.

Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request's HTTP Cookie Header.
For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.

If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain
and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

```js
pseudo-code example
router.get('/login', async function (req, res) {
const flow = await client.getLoginFlow(req.header('cookie'), req.query['flow'])

res.render('login', flow)

This request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:

`session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
`self_service_flow_expired`: The flow is expired and you should request a new one.

When accessing this endpoint through Ory Kratos' Public API you must ensure that either the Ory Kratos Session Cookie
or the Ory Kratos Session Token are set.

Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator
Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.

You can access this endpoint without credentials when using Ory Kratos' Admin API.

If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
`session_inactive`: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first.
`security_identity_mismatch`: The flow was interrupted with `session_refresh_required` but apparently some other
identity logged in instead.

If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain
and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

```js
pseudo-code example
router.get('/recovery', async function (req, res) {
const flow = await client.getVerificationFlow(req.header('cookie'), req.query['flow'])

res.render('verification', flow)
})
```

ToSession Check Who the Current HTTP Session Belongs To

Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated.
Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent.
When the request it successful it adds the user ID to the 'X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id' header
in the response.

If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:

```js
pseudo-code example
router.get('/protected-endpoint', async function (req, res) {
const session = await client.toSession(undefined, req.header('cookie'))

console.log(session)
})
```

When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:

```js
pseudo-code example
...
const session = await client.toSession("the-session-token")

console.log(session)
```

When using a token template, the token is included in the `tokenized` field of the session.

```js
pseudo-code example
...
const session = await client.toSession("the-session-token", { tokenize_as: "example-jwt-template" })

console.log(session.tokenized) // The JWT
```

Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator
Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.

This endpoint is useful for:

AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly!
Reverse proxies and API Gateways
Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!

This endpoint authenticates users by checking:

if the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie;
if the `Authorization: bearer <ory-session-token>` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token;
if the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.

If none of these headers are set or the cookie or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.

As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:

`session_inactive`: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token).
`session_aal2_required`: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

/*
UpdateLoginFlow Submit a Login Flow

Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint
behaves differently for API and browser flows.

API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and responds with
HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success;
HTTP 410 if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set and optionally a `use_flow_id` parameter in the body;
HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after login URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the login succeeded;
a HTTP 303 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
`security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
`browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

UpdateLogoutFlow Update Logout Flow

This endpoint logs out an identity in a self-service manner.

If the `Accept` HTTP header is not set to `application/json`, the browser will be redirected (HTTP 303 See Other)
to the `return_to` parameter of the initial request or fall back to `urls.default_return_to`.

If the `Accept` HTTP header is set to `application/json`, a 204 No Content response
will be sent on successful logout instead.

This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for API clients and only works
with browsers (Chrome, Firefox, ...). For API clients you can
call the `/self-service/logout/api` URL directly with the Ory Session Token.

UpdateRecoveryFlow Update Recovery Flow

Use this endpoint to update a recovery flow. This endpoint
behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

`choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid.
and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended.
`sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` for the `link` method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It
works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
`passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a recovery link")
does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL
(if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with
a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

behaves differently for API and browser flows.

API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the created identity success - if the session hook is configured the
`session` and `session_token` will also be included;
HTTP 410 if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set and optionally a `use_flow_id` parameter in the body;
HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the registration succeeded;
a HTTP 303 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
`security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
`browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

UpdateSettingsFlow Complete Settings Flow

Use this endpoint to complete a settings flow by sending an identity's updated password. This endpoint
behaves differently for API and browser flows.

API-initiated flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success;
HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
HTTP 400 on form validation errors.
HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token.
HTTP 403 when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.
Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.

Browser flows without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` respond with
a HTTP 303 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the flow succeeded;
a HTTP 303 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.
a HTTP 303 redirect to the login endpoint when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.

Browser flows with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` respond with
HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
HTTP 303 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session cookie.
HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session's AAL is too low.
HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator
Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.

If this endpoint is called with a `Accept: application/json` HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

`session_refresh_required`: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect
the identity to the login init endpoint with query parameters `?refresh=true&return_to=<the-current-browser-url>`,
or initiate a refresh login flow otherwise.
`security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
`session_inactive`: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first.
`security_identity_mismatch`: The flow was interrupted with `session_refresh_required` but apparently some other
identity logged in instead.
`security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
`browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

UpdateVerificationFlow Complete Verification Flow

Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow. This endpoint
behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

`choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid
and a HTTP 303 See Other redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 303 See Other redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended.
`sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` when using the `link` method and allows the user to request another verification email. It
works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
`passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a verification link")
does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 303 See Other redirect either to the Settings UI URL
(if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with
a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.
