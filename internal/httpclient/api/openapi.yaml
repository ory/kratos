    Documentation for all public and administrative Ory Kratos APIs. Public and administrative APIs
    are exposed on different ports. Public APIs can face the public internet without any protection
    while administrative APIs should never be exposed without prior authorization. To protect
    the administative API port you should use something like Nginx, Ory Oathkeeper, or any other
    technology capable of authorizing incoming requests.

        This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when Ory Kratos is accepting incoming
        HTTP requests. This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.

        If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the
        `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to be set.

        Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never
        refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

        :::info

        This endpoint is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to potential breaking changes in the future.

        :::

        Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows.

        API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and responds with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after login URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the login succeeded;
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

        Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request's HTTP Cookie Header.
        For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        router.get('/login', async function (req, res) {

        Use this endpoint to complete a recovery flow. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid.
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` for the `link` method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a recovery link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with
        a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

        and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        router.get('/recovery', async function (req, res) {
        const flow = await client.getSelfServiceRecoveryFlow(req.header('Cookie'), req.query['flow'])

        res.render('recovery', flow)
        })
        ```

        Use this endpoint to complete a recovery flow using the link method. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` and allows the user to request another recovery email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a recovery link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with
        a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

        Use this endpoint to complete a registration flow by sending an identity's traits and password. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows.

        API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the created identity success - if the session hook is configured the
        `session` and `session_token` will also be included;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh registration flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the registration succeeded;
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

        Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        This endpoint initializes a browser-based user settings flow. Once initialized, the browser will be redirected to
        `selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If no valid
        Ory Kratos Session Cookie is included in the request, a login flow will be initialized.

        If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to
        `selfservice.flows.settings.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If no valid user session
        was set, the browser will be redirected to the login endpoint.

        If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the settings flow without any redirects
        or a 403 forbidden error if no valid session was set.

        This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for clients that do not have a browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...) as cookies are needed.

        Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` when using the `link` method and allows the user to request another verification email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a verification link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with
        a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.

        Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request's HTTP Cookie Header.
        For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.

        If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain
        and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        router.get('/recovery', async function (req, res) {
        const flow = await client.getSelfServiceVerificationFlow(req.header('cookie'), req.query['flow'])

        Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated.

        Reverse proxies and API Gateways
        Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!

        if the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie;
        if the `Authorization: bearer <ory-session-token>` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token;
        if the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token;
        if the `X-Session-Cookie` HTTP header was set containing a valid Ory Kratos Session Cookie (only the value!).

        If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.
