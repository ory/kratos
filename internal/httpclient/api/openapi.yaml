    Documentation for all public and administrative Ory Kratos APIs. Public and administrative APIs
    are exposed on different ports. Public APIs can face the public internet without any protection
    while administrative APIs should never be exposed without prior authorization. To protect
    the administative API port you should use something like Nginx, Ory Oathkeeper, or any other
    technology capable of authorizing incoming requests.

        This endpoint provides JavaScript which is needed in order to perform WebAuthn login and registration.

        If you are building a JavaScript Browser App (e.g. in ReactJS or AngularJS) you will need to load this file:

        ```html
        <script src="https://public-kratos.example.org/.well-known/ory/webauthn.js" type="script" async />
        ```

        This endpoint returns a HTTP 200 status code when Ory Kratos is accepting incoming
        HTTP requests. This status does currently not include checks whether the database connection is working.

        If the service supports TLS Edge Termination, this endpoint does not require the
        `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to be set.

        Be aware that if you are running multiple nodes of this service, the health status will never
        refer to the cluster state, only to a single instance.

        :::info

        This endpoint is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to potential breaking changes in the future.

        :::

        Use this endpoint to complete a login flow. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows.

        API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and responds with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the session token on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after login URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the login succeeded;
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the login UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

        Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
        case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

        `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
        `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
        `security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
        `browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
        Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

        This endpoint initiates a login flow for API clients that do not use a browser, such as mobile devices, smart TVs, and so on.

        If a valid provided session cookie or session token is provided, a 400 Bad Request error
        will be returned unless the URL query parameter `?refresh=true` is set.

        To fetch an existing login flow call `/self-service/login/flows?flow=<flow_id>`.

        You MUST NOT use this endpoint in client-side (Single Page Apps, ReactJS, AngularJS) nor server-side (Java Server
        Pages, NodeJS, PHP, Golang, ...) browser applications. Using this endpoint in these applications will make
        you vulnerable to a variety of CSRF attacks, including CSRF login attacks.

        In the case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

        `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
        `session_aal1_required`: Multi-factor auth (e.g. 2fa) was requested but the user has no session yet.
        `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.

        This endpoint MUST ONLY be used in scenarios such as native mobile apps (React Native, Objective C, Swift, Java, ...).

        This endpoint returns a login flow's context with, for example, error details and other information.

        Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request's HTTP Cookie Header.
        For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.

        If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain
        and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        router.get('/login', async function (req, res) {
        const flow = await client.getSelfServiceLoginFlow(req.header('cookie'), req.query['flow'])

        res.render('login', flow)
        })
        ```

        This request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:

        `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
        `self_service_flow_expired`: The flow is expired and you should request a new one.

        Use this endpoint to complete a recovery flow. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid.
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh recovery flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Recovery UI URL with the Recovery Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` for the `link` method and allows the user to request another recovery email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a recovery link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Recover UI URL with
        a new Recovery Flow ID which contains an error message that the recovery link was invalid.

        Use this endpoint to complete a registration flow by sending an identity's traits and password. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows.

        API flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the created identity success - if the session hook is configured the
        `session` and `session_token` will also be included;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh registration flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        Browser flows expect a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after registration URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the registration succeeded;
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the registration UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.

        Browser flows with an accept header of `application/json` will not redirect but instead respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        If this endpoint is called with `Accept: application/json` in the header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
        case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

        `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
        `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
        `security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
        `browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
        Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

        :::info

        This endpoint is EXPERIMENTAL and subject to potential breaking changes in the future.

        :::

        If this endpoint is opened as a link in the browser, it will be redirected to
        `selfservice.flows.registration.ui_url` with the flow ID set as the query parameter `?flow=`. If a valid user session
        exists already, the browser will be redirected to `urls.default_redirect_url`.

        If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
        case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

        `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
        `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
        `security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!

        If this endpoint is called via an AJAX request, the response contains the registration flow without a redirect.

        This endpoint is NOT INTENDED for clients that do not have a browser (Chrome, Firefox, ...) as cookies are needed.

        This endpoint returns a registration flow's context with, for example, error details and other information.

        Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request's HTTP Cookie Header.
        For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.

        If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain
        and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        router.get('/registration', async function (req, res) {
        const flow = await client.getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow(req.header('cookie'), req.query['flow'])

        res.render('registration', flow)
        })
        ```

        This request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:

        `session_already_available`: The user is already signed in.
        `self_service_flow_expired`: The flow is expired and you should request a new one.

        Use this endpoint to complete a settings flow by sending an identity's updated password. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows.

        API-initiated flows expect `application/json` to be sent in the body and respond with
        HTTP 200 and an application/json body with the session token on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh settings flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.
        HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session token.
        HTTP 403 when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.
        Implies that the user needs to re-authenticate.

        Browser flows without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` respond with
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the post/after settings URL or the `return_to` value if it was set and if the flow succeeded;
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the Settings UI URL with the flow ID containing the validation errors otherwise.
        a HTTP 302 redirect to the login endpoint when `selfservice.flows.settings.privileged_session_max_age` was reached or the session's AAL is too low.

        Browser flows with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` respond with
        HTTP 200 and a application/json body with the signed in identity and a `Set-Cookie` header on success;
        HTTP 302 redirect to a fresh login flow if the original flow expired with the appropriate error messages set;
        HTTP 401 when the endpoint is called without a valid session cookie.
        HTTP 403 when the page is accessed without a session cookie or the session's AAL is too low.
        HTTP 400 on form validation errors.

        Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 error if the session has a lower Authenticator
        Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
        credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
        to sign in with the second factor (happens automatically for server-side browser flows) or change the configuration.

        If this endpoint is called with a `Accept: application/json` HTTP header, the response contains the flow without a redirect. In the
        case of an error, the `error.id` of the JSON response body can be one of:

        `session_refresh_required`: The identity requested to change something that needs a privileged session. Redirect
        the identity to the login init endpoint with query parameters `?refresh=true&return_to=<the-current-browser-url>`,
        or initiate a refresh login flow otherwise.
        `security_csrf_violation`: Unable to fetch the flow because a CSRF violation occurred.
        `session_inactive`: No Ory Session was found - sign in a user first.
        `security_identity_mismatch`: The flow was interrupted with `session_refresh_required` but apparently some other
        identity logged in instead.
        `security_identity_mismatch`: The requested `?return_to` address is not allowed to be used. Adjust this in the configuration!
        `browser_location_change_required`: Usually sent when an AJAX request indicates that the browser needs to open a specific URL.
        Most likely used in Social Sign In flows.

        Use this endpoint to complete a verification flow. This endpoint
        behaves differently for API and browser flows and has several states:

        `choose_method` expects `flow` (in the URL query) and `email` (in the body) to be sent
        and works with API- and Browser-initiated flows.
        For API clients and Browser clients with HTTP Header `Accept: application/json` it either returns a HTTP 200 OK when the form is valid and HTTP 400 OK when the form is invalid
        and a HTTP 302 Found redirect with a fresh verification flow if the flow was otherwise invalid (e.g. expired).
        For Browser clients without HTTP Header `Accept` or with `Accept: text/*` it returns a HTTP 302 Found redirect to the Verification UI URL with the Verification Flow ID appended.
        `sent_email` is the success state after `choose_method` when using the `link` method and allows the user to request another verification email. It
        works for both API and Browser-initiated flows and returns the same responses as the flow in `choose_method` state.
        `passed_challenge` expects a `token` to be sent in the URL query and given the nature of the flow ("sending a verification link")
        does not have any API capabilities. The server responds with a HTTP 302 Found redirect either to the Settings UI URL
        (if the link was valid) and instructs the user to update their password, or a redirect to the Verification UI URL with
        a new Verification Flow ID which contains an error message that the verification link was invalid.

        This endpoint returns a verification flow's context with, for example, error details and other information.

        Browser flows expect the anti-CSRF cookie to be included in the request's HTTP Cookie Header.
        For AJAX requests you must ensure that cookies are included in the request or requests will fail.

        If you use the browser-flow for server-side apps, the services need to run on a common top-level-domain
        and you need to forward the incoming HTTP Cookie header to this endpoint:

        ```js

        Uses the HTTP Headers in the GET request to determine (e.g. by using checking the cookies) who is authenticated.
        Returns a session object in the body or 401 if the credentials are invalid or no credentials were sent.
        Additionally when the request it successful it adds the user ID to the 'X-Kratos-Authenticated-Identity-Id' header in the response.

        If you call this endpoint from a server-side application, you must forward the HTTP Cookie Header to this endpoint:

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        router.get('/protected-endpoint', async function (req, res) {
        const session = await client.toSession(undefined, req.header('cookie'))

        console.log(session)
        })
        ```

        When calling this endpoint from a non-browser application (e.g. mobile app) you must include the session token:

        ```js
        pseudo-code example
        ...
        const session = await client.toSession("the-session-token")

        console.log(session)
        ```

        Depending on your configuration this endpoint might return a 403 status code if the session has a lower Authenticator
        Assurance Level (AAL) than is possible for the identity. This can happen if the identity has password + webauthn
        credentials (which would result in AAL2) but the session has only AAL1. If this error occurs, ask the user
        to sign in with the second factor or change the configuration.

        This endpoint is useful for:

        AJAX calls. Remember to send credentials and set up CORS correctly!
        Reverse proxies and API Gateways
        Server-side calls - use the `X-Session-Token` header!

        This endpoint authenticates users by checking

        if the `Cookie` HTTP header was set containing an Ory Kratos Session Cookie;
        if the `Authorization: bearer <ory-session-token>` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token;
        if the `X-Session-Token` HTTP header was set with a valid Ory Kratos Session Token.

        If none of these headers are set or the cooke or token are invalid, the endpoint returns a HTTP 401 status code.

        As explained above, this request may fail due to several reasons. The `error.id` can be one of:

        `session_inactive`: No active session was found in the request (e.g. no Ory Session Cookie / Ory Session Token).
        `session_aal2_required`: An active session was found but it does not fulfil the Authenticator Assurance Level, implying that the session must (e.g.) authenticate the second factor.

          Set the Cookie Header. This is especially useful when calling this endpoint from a server-side application. In that
          scenario you must include the HTTP Cookie Header which originally was included in the request to your server.
          An example of a session in the HTTP Cookie Header is: `ory_kratos_session=a19iOVAbdzdgl70Rq1QZmrKmcjDtdsviCTZx7m9a9yHIUS8Wa9T7hvqyGTsLHi6Qifn2WUfpAKx9DWp0SJGleIn9vh2YF4A16id93kXFTgIgmwIOvbVAScyrx7yVl6bPZnCx27ec4WQDtaTewC1CpgudeDV2jQQnSaCP6ny3xa8qLH-QUgYqdQuoA_LF1phxgRCUfIrCLQOkolX5nv3ze_f==`.

          It is ok if more than one cookie are included here as all other cookies will be ignored.
