## Breaking Changes

This patch removes the ability to use domain aliases, an obscure feature rarely used that had several issues and inconsistencies.



### Bug Fixes

* Add hiring notice to README ([#2074](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2074)) ([0c1e816](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/0c1e816693ad4a6c3fdb7206bbc95c81cdfdf3c0))
* Add missing version tag in quickstart.yml ([#2110](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2110)) ([1d281ea](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/1d281ea69e551cc3d40415f5405690f445891bb6))
* Choose correct CSRF cookie when multiple are set ([633076b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/633076be008104afd50186ebe60722ef21999d5d)), closes [ory/kratos#2121](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2121) [ory-corp/cloud#1786](https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/1786):

    Resolves an issue where, when multiple CSRF cookies are set, a random one would be used to verify the CSRF token. Now, regardless of how many conflicting CSRF cookies exist, if one of them is valid, the request will pass and clean up the cookie store.

* **continuity:** Properly reset cookies that became invalid ([8e4b4fb](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/8e4b4fb3d6dbe668cf0166f4cff49eae753d481c)), closes [#2121](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2121) [ory-corp/cloud#1786](https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/1786):

    Resolves several reports related to incorrect handling of invalid continuity issues.

* **continuity:** Remove cookie on any error ([428ac03](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/428ac03b582184dbbbc0c9c3ffd399273fd8e1a5))
* Do not send session after registration without hook ([#2094](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2094)) ([3044229](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/3044229227229e81a4ba770eec241a748dd0945c)), closes [#2093](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2093)
* Explain mitigations in cookie error messages ([ef4b01a](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/ef4b01a80ea91114b182ff26759d98cd5ba2cd02))
* Resolve configx regression ([672c0ff](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/672c0ffc7f5edd1fd238dcdd0c5d0430b30966c6))
* **selfservice:** Recovery self service flow passes on return_to URL ([#1920](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1920)) ([b925d35](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/b925d351dd0ce48cb6aed046dcf2698796453751)), closes [#914](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/914)
* Send 404 instead of null response for unknown verification flows ([#2102](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2102)) ([c9490c8](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/c9490c8927209b686aafe54b8a16207a8ef47ebe)), closes [#2099](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2099):

    Fixes the verification handler to write the error, instead of nil object, when the flow does not exist. Adds tests for every handler to check proper behavior in that regard.

* Support setting complex configs from the environment ([c45bf83](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/c45bf83a9e6744a0b3f2f24e3b07a6f0131d9a40)):

    Closes https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1535
    Closes https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1792
    Closes https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1801

* Update download urls according to the new names ([#2078](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2078)) ([86ae016](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/86ae0166c8893b809929c7c45a2ba84416ddf228))

### Code Refactoring

* Deprecate domain aliases ([894a2cc](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/894a2cc39671fbc9d2c13b1fc1b45b217da5145d))

### Documentation

* Fix incorrect port ([c9a3587](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/c9a358717a99af436c6802f45c9c1f6edc77585f)), closes [#2095](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2095)
* Fix link ([c245ed4](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/c245ed40d443e3068bc5eee902e6b14f6ae777c6)):

    Closes https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/issues/164

* Ory cloud mentions + spelling ([#2100](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2100)) ([0c2fa5b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/0c2fa5bdb98b95877ef740297b6d96a931a3430f))
* Typo ([#2073](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2073)) ([e1a54f9](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/e1a54f9129d41b34cc8864c8ac38d1448e1f9372))
* Typo ([#2114](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2114)) ([a7a16d7](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/a7a16d7c91d89e274ea5fd79787cd4671d825532))
* Update docker guide ([072ca4d](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/072ca4d990cf4060555c8b2626f39ff18172d064)), closes [#2086](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2086)

### Features

* Add preset CSP nonce ([#2096](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2096)) ([8913292](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/8913292c1193c416e5a54997e3635bef87affc01)):

    Closes https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/issues/162

* Added phone number identifier ([#1938](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1938)) ([294dfa8](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/294dfa85b4552b9266c44bb3376b8610c1ff5521)), closes [#137](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/137)
* Allow registration to be disabled ([#2081](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2081)) ([864b00d](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/864b00d6ecddefdb06ac22fda04670bfa43f2fd5)), closes [#882](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/882)
* **courier:** Override default link base URL ([cc99096](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/cc99096d07408c8b713ef9a7b17b8345597a9129)):

    Added a new configuration value `selfservice.methods.link.config.base_url` which allows to change the default base URL of recovery and verification links. This is useful when the email should send a link which does not match the globally configured base URL.
    
    See https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/1766

* Enable Buildkit ([#2079](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2079)) ([f40df5c](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/f40df5cd932aa3185b2155368db51a49b7f05991)):

    Looks like this was attempted before but the magic comment was not on the first line.

* Expose courier template load ([#2082](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2082)) ([790716e](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/790716e58a4be06f04f3cbc5b974f16d873ae0d8))

### Tests

* Update cypress ([#2090](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/2090)) ([883a1b1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/883a1b1ea33a1d3ef8b33342328382b59e4f18c3))


# [0.8.2-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.8.1-alpha.1...v0.8.2-alpha.1) (2021-12-17)

This release addresses further important security updates in the base Docker Images. We also resolved all issues related to ARM support on both Linux and macOS and fixed a bug that prevent the binary from compiling on FreeBSD.

This release also makes use of our new build architecture which means that the Docker Images names have changed. We removed the "scratch" images as we received frequent complaints about them. Additionally,
all Docker Images have now, per default, SQLite support built-in. If you are relying on the SQLite images, update your Docker Pull commands as follows:

```patch
- docker pull oryd/kratos:{version}-sqlite
+ docker pull oryd/kratos:{version}
```

Additionally, all passwords now have to be at least 8 characters long, following recommendations from Microsoft and others.

In v0.8.1-alpha.1 we failed to include all the exciting things that landed, so we'll cover them now!

1. Advanced E-Mail templating support with sprig - makes it possible to translate emails as well!
2. Support wildcards for allowing redirection targets.
3. Account Recovery initiated by the Admin API now works even if identities have no email address.

Enjoy this release!

We are extremely excited to share this next generation of Ory Kratos! The project is truly maturing and the community is getting larger by the hour.

On this special occasion, we would like to bring to your attention that the [**Ory Summit is happening tomorrow and on Friday!**](https://events.hubilo.com/ory-summit/register?mtm_campaign=ory-summit-2021&mtm_kwd=banner-landingpage) You will hear gripping talks from the Ory Community and Ory maintainers! And the best part, tickets are free and we are covering multiple time zones!

This release is truly the best version of Ory Kratos to date and we want to give you a tl;dr of the 345 commits and 1152 files changed, and what you can expect from this release:

- Full multi-factor authentication with different enforcement policies (soft/hard MFA).
- Support for WebAuthn (FIDO2 / U2F) two-factor authentication - from fingerprints to hardware tokens every FIDO2 device is supported!
- Ability to fetch the initial OAuth2 Access and Refresh and OpenID Connect ID Tokens an identity receives when performing social sign up. Optionally, these tokens are stored encrypted in the database (XChaCha20Poly1305 or AES-GCM)!
- Support for TOTP (Google Authenticator) two-factor verification/authentication.
- Advanced two-factor recovery with lookup secrets.
- [A complete reference implementation of the Ory Kratos end-user (self-service) facing UI in ReactJS & VercelJS](https://github.com/ory/kratos-react-nextjs-ui).
- "Native" support for Single-Page App Single Sign-On.
- Much improved single-page app and native app APIs for all self-service flows.
- Support for PKBDF2 password hashing, which will help import user passwords from other systems in the future.
- Bugfixes and improvements to the OpenAPI spec and auto-generated SDKs.
- ARM Docker Images.
- Greatly improved internal e2e test pipeline using Cypress 8.x.
- Improved functional tests with cupaloy snapshot testing.
- Documentation on different error codes and message identifiers to easier translate messages in your own UI.
- Better form decoding and ability to mark required JSON Schema fields as required in the UI.
- Bug fixes that could result in users ending up in irrecoverable UI states.
- Better support for `return_to` across flows (e.g. OIDC) and in custom UIs.
- SBOM Software Supply Chain scanning & reporting.
- Docker Image vulnerability checking as part of the release pipeline.
- Support sending emails via AWS SES SMTP.
- A REST endpoint to invalidate all an identity's sessions.

As you can see, much has happened and we are grateful for all the great interactions we have with you, every day!

Let's take a look at some of the breaking changes. Even though much was added, little has changed in breaking ways! This is a testament that Ory Kratos' internals and APIs are becoming more stable!

This release requires you to run SQL migrations. Please, as always, create a backup of your database first!

The SDKs are now generated with tag v0alpha2 to reflect that some signatures have changed in a breaking fashion. Please update your imports from `v0alpha1` to `v0alpha2`.

The SMTPS scheme used in courier config URL with cleartext/StartTLS/TLS SMTP connection types is now only supporting implicit TLS. For StartTLS and cleartext SMTP, please use the SMTP scheme instead.

Example:
- SMTP Cleartext: `smtp://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/?disable_starttls=true`
- SMTP with StartTLS: `smtps://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/` -> `smtp://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/`
- SMTP with implicit TLS: `smtps://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/?legacy_ssl=true` -> `smtps://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/We are extremely excited to share this next generation of Ory Kratos! The project is truly maturing and the community is getting larger by the hour.

On this special occasion, we would like to bring to your attention that the [**Ory Summit is happening tomorrow and on Friday!**](https://events.hubilo.com/ory-summit/register?mtm_campaign=ory-summit-2021&mtm_kwd=banner-landingpage) You will hear gripping talks from the Ory Community and Ory maintainers! And the best part, tickets are free and we are covering multiple time zones!

This release is truly the best version of Ory Kratos to date and we want to give you a tl;dr of the 345 commits and 1152 files changed, and what you can expect from this release:

- Full multi-factor authentication with different enforcement policies (soft/hard MFA).
- Support for WebAuthn (FIDO2 / U2F) two-factor authentication - from fingerprints to hardware tokens every FIDO2 device is supported!
- Ability to fetch the initial OAuth2 Access and Refresh and OpenID Connect ID Tokens an identity receives when performing social sign up. Optionally, these tokens are stored encrypted in the database (XChaCha20Poly1305 or AES-GCM)!
- Support for TOTP (Google Authenticator) two-factor verification/authentication.
- Advanced two-factor recovery with lookup secrets.
- [A complete reference implementation of the Ory Kratos end-user (self-service) facing UI in ReactJS & VercelJS](https://github.com/ory/kratos-react-nextjs-ui).
- "Native" support for Single-Page App Single Sign-On.
- Much improved single-page app and native app APIs for all self-service flows.
- Support for PKBDF2 password hashing, which will help import user passwords from other systems in the future.
- Bugfixes and improvements to the OpenAPI spec and auto-generated SDKs.
- ARM Docker Images.
- Greatly improved internal e2e test pipeline using Cypress 8.x.
- Improved functional tests with cupaloy snapshot testing.
- Documentation on different error codes and message identifiers to easier translate messages in your own UI.
- Better form decoding and ability to mark required JSON Schema fields as required in the UI.
- Bug fixes that could result in users ending up in irrecoverable UI states.
- Better support for `return_to` across flows (e.g. OIDC) and in custom UIs.
- SBOM Software Supply Chain scanning & reporting.
- Docker Image vulnerability checking as part of the release pipeline.
- Support sending emails via AWS SES SMTP.
- A REST endpoint to invalidate all an identity's sessions.

## Breaking Changes

The location of the homebrew tap has changed from `ory/ory/kratos` to `ory/tap/kratos`.

To stay consistent with other query parameter's, the self-service login flow's `forced` key has been renamed to `refresh`.

The SDKs are now generated with tag v0alpha2 to reflect that some signatures have changed in a breaking fashion. Please update your imports from `v0alpha1` to `v0alpha2`.

To support 2FA on non-browser (e.g. native mobile) apps we have added the Ory Session Token as a possible parameter to both `initializeSelfServiceLoginFlowWithoutBrowser` and `submitSelfServiceLoginFlow`. Depending on the SDK generator, the order of the arguments may have changed. In JavaScript:

```patch
- .submitSelfServiceLoginFlow(flow.id, payload)
+ .submitSelfServiceLoginFlow(flow.id, sessionToken, payload)
+ // or if the user has no session yet:
+ .submitSelfServiceLoginFlow(flow.id, undefined, payload)
```

To improve the overall API design we have changed the result of `POST /self-service/settings`. Instead of having flow be a key, the flow is now the response. The updated identity payload stays the same!

```patch
 {
-  "flow": {
-    "id": "flow-id-..."
-    ...
-  },
+  "id": "flow-id-..."
+  ...
   "identity": {
     "id": "identity-id-..."
   }
 }
```

The SMTPS scheme used in courier config url with cleartext/StartTLS/TLS SMTP connection types is now only supporting implicit TLS. For StartTLS and cleartext SMTP, please use the smtp scheme instead.

Example:
- SMTP Cleartext: `smtp://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/?disable_starttls=true`
- SMTP with StartTLS: `smtps://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/` -> `smtp://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/`
- SMTP with implicit TLS: `smtps://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/?legacy_ssl=true` -> `smtps://foo:bar@my-mailserver:1234/`

This patch changes the naming and number of prometheus metrics (see: https://github.com/ory/x/pull/379). In short: all metrics will have now `http_` prefix to conform to Prometheus best practices.

* Add aal fallback for existing sessions ([a5c7b11](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/a5c7b1143bca7029bf94fc42fe638534961a06bc))

* Add error ids for redirect-related errors ([246a045](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/246a0453e65e70635331c95ff02ec9133ae81e46))
* Add error ids for session-related errors ([087d907](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/087d90731185b71cd88cc6451ce360d6c1dada34))
* Add explicit return_to to flow objects and API parameters ([50d04ea](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/50d04eaa455932a9a5cc31f812f66518e1d4ad3b)), closes [#1605](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1605) [#1121](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1121):

    This patch adds a `return_to` field to the flow objects which contains the original `?return_to=...` value. It uses the Flow's `request_url` for that purpose.

* Add ids for user-facing errors for login, registration, settings ([787558b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/787558b48fd7405ac61a48d3c18c7252ac1aaf19)):

    This patch adds a new field `id` to JSON error payloads. This helps tremendously in implementing better client-side (native / SPA) apps as the API now returns error IDs like `no_active_session`, `orbidden_return_to`, `no_verified_address` and more. UIs can use these IDs to decide what to do next in the application - for example redirecting to a particular endpoint or showing an error message.

* Add initial value to bool checkboxes ([63dba73](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/63dba737376dbe2f15c5afb5df22c593328c6483))
* Add internal context to login and registration ([723e6ee](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/723e6eee731d34f85bc4346a1040f2f121662ae9))

* Add lookup node to disable lookup ([d0836be](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/d0836beb53709c88eb9ed78df39e95a3204c7cec)):

    See https://github.com/ory/cloud/issues/12

* Add lookup to config ([14119b6](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/14119b623941b6f5e795ef0d369ee9e3adb73207))

* Add ory cli config ([5b959be](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/5b959beaba4d03e143f7701c30bc30e25f2c51cc))
* Add schema patch for new initial_value field ([131e380](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/131e3803ff6d04af9ec668286c8e6fcf88467214)):

    The field sets a node input's initial value. This is primarily used for fields which are e.g. checkboxes or buttons (active/inactive). If this field is set on a button, it implies that clicking the button should trigger the "value" to be set.

* Add script type and discriminator for attributes ([de0af95](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/de0af955904894d97997cf598686b6d33cd88bd4)):

* Add support for onclick javascript in ui nodes ([7cc7efa](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/7cc7efa00ff0e8107f1369573bfdf766fcfc0e93))
* Add totp strategy for settings flow ([d1d6617](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/d1d6617013fbcc37eaf48cf19061b86955fc5d5e)):

    This patch allows adding a TOTP device in the settings, and also removing it when no longer needed.

* Add webauthn identity credential ([f8b9582](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/f8b95828ea41d29c7f3577cc7772168135bc5514))
* Adding Dockle Container Linter ([#1852](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1852)) ([3c0d519](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/3c0d519dd47657c6adca3d64bca8b3ed02cb7a8f))
* Adjust to new aal error handling ([b8956bc](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/b8956bc0fc8a45e88dd51f79608f9d6c34e2b6f3))
* API to return access, refresh, id tokens from social sign in ([#1818](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1818)) ([198991a](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/198991a9ce25fbaccc927be3bd3f6b1593771bec)), closes [#1518](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1518) [#397](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/397):

    This patch introduces the new `include_credential` query parameter to the `GET /identities` endpoint which allows administrators to receive the initial access, refresh, and ID tokens from Social Sign In (OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0) flows.
    
    These tokens can be stored in an encrypted format (XChaCha20Poly1305 or AES-GCM) in the database if an appropriate encryption secret is set. To get started easily these values are not encrypted per default.
    
    For more information head [over to the docs](https://kratos/docs/guides/retrieve-social-sign-in-access-refresh-id-token).

* Auto-generate list of messages ([cf46339](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/cf46339b9a07cd72b4d01e40c2df72e6c8104e9b)), closes [#1784](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1784)
* Endpoint to list all identity schemas ([#1703](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1703)) ([aa23d5d](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/aa23d5d5af28d8a7789b4a0c7e97197c7758ad98)), closes [#1699](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1699)

* Identity schema validation on startup ([#1779](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1779)) ([99db3f0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/99db3f03afd4b2525cbce54133a1abd1d49d2886)), closes [#701](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/701)
* **identity:** Add AAL constants ([882573d](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/882573df5621446e799b17ca0ab09d3934e44437))
* Implement AAL for login and sessions ([45467e0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/45467e0caba7ed31e2ebde71a8b32ecd5f8db7c2))

    This PR introduces endpoint to destroy all sessions for a given identity which effectively logouts user from all devices/sessions. This is useful when for some security concern we want to make sure there are no "old" sessions active or other "staff" related actions (such as force logout after password change etc.).

* Implement lookup code settings and login ([8f3ce7b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/8f3ce7b33390fcae85e605193806364ca9d099c9))

### Bug Fixes

* Add new message when refresh parameter is true ([#1560](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1560)) ([0525623](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/05256232bf85d68e068eece6c883f46a447ba5bd)), closes [#1117](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1117)
* Add session in spa registration if session cook is configured ([#1657](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1657)) ([639a7dd](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/639a7dd52d43c57e9708ed3e7360c17d6efde6a5)), closes [#1604](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1604)

* Facebook sign in regression ([#1689](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1689)) ([85337bf](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/85337bf65af767d7296b14e8fd21bab5c64d23e2)), closes [#1687](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1687) [#1686](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1686)
* Http context memory leak ([b21bd22](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/b21bd224059e8a42da9814237572a118297c5210)):

    Ory Kratos was using `gorilla/sessions` prior to version v1.2 which had a dependency on `gorilla/context`, a deprecated library with known memory management issues. Even though we used `gorilla/context`'s clean up middleware, it appears that `r.Context()` was not properly cleaned up, causing memory leaks.
    
    On average, the memory leak is pretty small, but depending on what gets added to `r.Context()` it could significantly increase the memory leak.
    
    By replacing `gorilla/sessions` with v1.2.1 we:
    
    1. Increased the HTTP API throughput by an estimate of 4 times;
    2. Brought average memory use back down to about 12MB;
    
    Closes https://github.com/ory-corp/cloud/issues/1292

* Outdated label ([#1681](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1681)) ([149101e](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/149101ed145dae2b75e5150013efc478f5fd0cc3))
* Register argon2 CLI commands properly ([#1592](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1592)) ([45c28d9](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/45c28d99064baf8051521a1078ac2b59bb3206ec))
* Remove session cookie on logout ([#1587](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1587)) ([cdb30bb](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/cdb30bb65ac932a17e4924b4efc8952113452513)), closes [#1584](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1584):

    Before, the logout endpoint would invalidate the session cookie, but not remove it. This was a regression introduced in 0.7.0. This patch resolves that issue.

* **sdk:** Use proper annotation for genericError ([#1611](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1611)) ([da214b2](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/da214b2933ae2a91d8c5bf6aa8eea613a2078b9d)), closes [#1609](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1609)
* Skip prompt on discord authorization by default ([#1594](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1594)) ([a667255](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/a6672554b02378eb2dac7b1af99ea2915395867b)):

    When a value for prompt is not provided, Discord defaults to `prompt="consent"`. This change makes it so that if the request is not forced, prompt is explicitly set to "none".

* Static parameter for warning message in config.baseURL(...) ([#1673](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1673)) ([db54a1b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/db54a1bd0c93d7a5845ee09d0a16cbc3b8f26a4a)), closes [#1672](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1672)

### Documentation

* Change model to schema ([#1639](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1639)) ([09c403e](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/09c403e55482e91a5bfe9a253e514b7a90826709))
* Fix func naming for Logout flow ([#1676](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1676)) ([bbeb613](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/bbeb6132ba82e28057bc14bf35ea99b70f0c4118)):

    rename createSelfServiceLogoutUrlForBrowsers  to createSelfServiceLogoutFlowUrlForBrowsers

* Fix stub error example ([#1642](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1642)) ([9bc2fd0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/9bc2fd088ed9b3e7334713e63bae3c7bbcb922db)), closes [#1568](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1568)
* Fixes incorrect yaml identation ([#1641](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1641)) ([6b58278](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/6b582784b49c1d103bbf7a6843cdf197fbd93931))
* Identity traits are visible to user ([#1621](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1621)) ([641eba6](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/641eba675bdc583661565a6378776bfad26067c6))
* Make qickstart URLs consistent (playground vs. localhost) ([#1626](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1626)) ([bae1847](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/bae1847eba0d925f28a010876e35e3c2093bc8c6)):

    Since the quick-start describes how to run Kratos locally the actual location of the redirect is `http://127.0.0.1:4433/self-service/login/browser`.

* Update docker.md - Outdated information ([#1627](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1627)) ([dc32720](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/dc32720de25f52b7deb3e32f7530c7827a6ce5df)), closes [#1619](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1619):

    Kratos does not automatically use a config file that exists at `$HOME/.kratos.yaml`, or any other similar pattern. The documentation in the Docker Images section of the guides could lead developers to believe that the --config flag is unnecessary if they are binding the directory the configuration file is in to $HOME or using a custom docker image to provide the file.


### Features

* Allow multiple webhook body sources ([#1606](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1606)) ([51b1311](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/51b131177c9e0db018eced939fef43742c9e86cf)):

    This patch adds support for loading webhooks from the local filesystem, base64 encoded inline string, and remote (http/https) sources. Please note that support for relative/absolute paths without an URI scheme are deprecated and will eventually be removed.

* Require verified address ([#1355](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1355)) ([1cf61cd](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/1cf61cdeedbd8bf5b66310793249681ff976baab)), closes [#1328](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1328)

    Up until now the extension meta schema was only applied to top level keys. This fix now recursively checks the extension schema on any depth.

* Remove domain alias config constraint ([#1542](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1542)) ([c6145db](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/c6145dbfb278369c8e3ad6eae7e8574ed49ba193))

# [0.7.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.6.3-alpha.1...v0.7.0-alpha.1) (2021-07-13)

About two months ago we released Ory Kratos v0.6. Today, we are excited to announce the next iteration of Ory Kratos v0.7! This release includes 215 commits from 24 contributors with over 770 files and more than 100.000 lines of code changed!

Ory Kratos v0.7 brings massive developer experience improvements:

- A reworked, tested, and standardized SDK based on OpenAPI 3.0.3 ([#1477](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1477), [#1424](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1424));
- Native support of Single-Page-Apps (ReactJS, AngularJS, ...) for all self-service flows ([#1367](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1367));
- Sign in with Yandex, VK, Auth0, Slack;
- An all-new, secure logout flow ([#1433](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1433));
- Important security updates to the self-service GET APIs ([#1458](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1458), [#1282](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1282));
- Built-in support for TLS ([#1466](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1466));
- Improved documentation and Go Module structure;
- Resolving a case-sensitivity bug in self-service recovery and verification flows;
- Improved performance for listing identities;
- Support for Instant tracing ([#1429](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1429));
- Improved control for SMTPS, supporting SSL and STARTTLS ([#1430](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1430));
- Ability to run Ory Kratos in networks without outbound requests ([#1445](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1445));
- Improved control over HTTP Cookie behavior ([#1531](https://github.com/ory/kratos/pull/1531));
- Several smaller user experience improvements and bug fixes;
- Improved e2e test pipeline.

In the next iteration of Ory Kratos, we will focus on providing a NextJS example application for the SPA integration as well as the long-awaited MFA flows!

Please be aware that upgrading to Ory Kratos 0.7 requires you to apply SQL migrations. Make sure to back up your database before migration!

For more details on breaking changes and patch notes, see below.



## Breaking Changes

Prior to this change it was not possible to specify the verification/recovery link lifetime. Instead, it was bound to the flow expiry. This patch changes that and adds the ability to configure the lifespan of the link individually:

```patch
 selfservice:
   methods:
     link:
       enabled: true
       config:
+        # Defines how long a recovery link is valid for (default 1h)
+        lifespan: 15m
```

This is a breaking change because the link strategy no longer respects the recovery / verification flow expiry time and, unless set, will default to one hour.

This change introduces a better SDK. As part of this change, several breaking changes with regards to the SDK have been introduced. We recommend reading this section carefully to understand the changes and how they might affect you.

Before, the SDK was structured into tags `public` and `admin`. This stems from the fact that we have two ports in Ory Kratos - one administrative and one public port.

While serves as a good overview when working with Ory Kratos, it does not express:

- What module the API belongs to (e.g. self-service, identity, ...)
- What maturity the API has (e.g. experimental, alpha, beta, ...)
- What version the API has (e.g. v0alpha0, v1beta0, ...)

This patch replaces the current `admin` and `public` tags with a versioned approach indicating the maturity of the API used. For example, `initializeSelfServiceSettingsForBrowsers` would no longer be under the `public` tag but instead under the `v0alpha1` tag:

```patch
import {
  Configuration,
- PublicApi
+ V0Alpha1
} from '@ory/kratos-client';

- const kratos = new PublicApi(new Configuration({ basePath: config.kratos.public }));
+ const kratos = new V0Alpha1(new Configuration({ basePath: config.kratos.public }));
```

To avoid confusion when setting up the SDK, and potentially using the wrong endpoints in your codebase and ending up with strange 404 errors, Ory Kratos now redirects you to the correct port, given that `serve.(public|admin).base_url` are configured correctly. This is a significant improvement towards a more robust API experience!

Further, all administrative functions require, in the Ory SaaS, authorization using e.g. an Ory Personal Access Token. In the open source, we do not know what developers use to protect their APIs. As such, we believe that it is ok to have admin and public functions under one common API and differentiate with an `admin` prefix. Therefore, the following patches should be made in your codebase:

```patch
import {
- AdminApi,
+ V0Alpha1,
  Configuration
} from '@ory/kratos-client';

-const kratos = new AdminApi(new Configuration({ basePath: config.kratos.admin }));
+const kratos = new V0Alpha1(new Configuration({ basePath: config.kratos.admin }));

-kratos.createIdentity({
+kratos.adminCreateIdentity({
  schema_id: 'default',
  traits: { /* ... */ }
})
```

Further, we have introduced a [style guide for writing SDKs annotations](https://www.ory.sh/docs/ecosystem/contributing#openapi-spec-and-go-swagger) governing how naming conventions should be chosen.

We also streamlined how credentials are used. We now differentiate between:

- Per-request credentials such as the Ory Session Token / Cookie
    ```
    - public getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow(id: string, cookie?: string, options?: any) {}
    + public getSelfServiceSettingsFlow(id: string, xSessionToken?: string, cookie?: string, options?: any) {}
    ```
- Global credentials such as the Ory (SaaS) Personal Access Token.
    ```typescript
    const kratos = new V0Alpha0(new Configuration({ basePath: config.kratos.admin, accessToken: 'some-token' }));

    kratosAdmin.adminCreateIdentity({
      schema_id: 'default',
      traits: { /* ... */ },
    });
    ```

This patch introduces CSRF countermeasures for fetching all self-service flows. This ensures that users can not accidentally leak sensitive information when copy/pasting e.g. login URLs (see #1282). If a self-service flow for browsers is requested, the CSRF cookie must be included in the call, regardless if it is a client-side browser app or a server-side browser app calling. This **does not apply** for API-based flows.

As part of this change, the following endpoints have been removed:

- `GET <ory-kratos-admin>/self-service/login/flows`;
- `GET <ory-kratos-admin>/self-service/registration/flows`;
- `GET <ory-kratos-admin>/self-service/verification/flows`;
- `GET <ory-kratos-admin>/self-service/recovery/flows`;
- `GET <ory-kratos-admin>/self-service/settings/flows`.

Please ensure that your server-side applications use the public port (e.g. `GET <ory-kratos-public>/self-service/login/flows`) for fetching self-service flows going forward.

If you use the SDKs, upgrading is easy by adding the `cookie` header when fetching the flows. This is only required when **using browser flows on the server side**.

The following example illustrates a ExpressJS (NodeJS) server-side application fetching the self-service flows.

```patch
app.get('some-route', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
-   kratos.getSelfServiceLoginFlow(flow).then((flow) => /* ... */ )
+   kratos.getSelfServiceLoginFlow(flow, req.header('cookie')).then((flow) => /* ... */ )

-   kratos.getSelfServiceRecoveryFlow(flow).then((flow) => /* ... */ )
+   kratos.getSelfServiceRecoveryFlow(flow, req.header('cookie')).then((flow) => /* ... */ )

-   kratos.getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow(flow).then((flow) => /* ... */ )
+   kratos.getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow(flow, req.header('cookie')).then((flow) => /* ... */ )

-   kratos.getSelfServiceVerificationFlow(flow).then((flow) => /* ... */ )
+   kratos.getSelfServiceVerificationFlow(flow, req.header('cookie')).then((flow) => /* ... */ )

-   kratos.getSelfServiceSettingsFlow(flow).then((flow) => /* ... */ )
+   kratos.getSelfServiceSettingsFlow(flow, undefined, req.header('cookie')).then((flow) => /* ... */ )
})
```

This patch refactors the logout functionality for browsers and APIs. It adds increased security and DoS-defenses to the logout flow.

Previously, calling `GET /self-service/browser/flows/logout` would remove the session cookie and redirect the user to the logout endpoint. Now you have to make a call to `GET /self-service/logout/browser` which returns a JSON response including a `logout_url` URL to be used for logout. The call to `/self-service/logout/browser` must be made using AJAX with cookies enabled or by including the Ory Session Cookie in the `X-Session-Cookie` HTTP Header. You may also use the SDK method `createSelfServiceLogoutUrlForBrowsers` to do that.

Additionally, the endpoint `DELETE /sessions` has been moved to `DELETE /self-service/logout/api`. Payloads and responses stay equal. The SDK method `revokeSession` has been renamed to `submitSelfServiceLogoutFlowWithoutBrowser`.

We listened to your feedback and have improved the naming of the SDK method `initializeSelfServiceRecoveryForNativeApps` to better match what it does: `initializeSelfServiceRecoveryWithoutBrowser`. As in the previous release you may still use the old SDK if you do not want to deal with the SDK breaking changes for now.

If you do not wish to update your code, you can keep using the Ory Kratos v0.6.2 SDK and upgrade to v0.6.3+ SDKs at a later stage, as only naming conventions have changed!



## Breaking Changes

Unfortunately, some method signatures have changed in the SDKs. Below is a list of changed entries:

- Error `genericError` was renamed to `jsonError` and now includes more information and better typing for errors;
- The following functions have been renamed:
   - `initializeSelfServiceLoginViaAPIFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceLoginForNativeApps`
   - `initializeSelfServiceLoginViaBrowserFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceLoginForBrowsers`
   - `initializeSelfServiceRegistrationViaAPIFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceRegistrationForNativeApps`
   - `initializeSelfServiceRegistrationViaBrowserFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceRegistrationForBrowsers`
   - `initializeSelfServiceSettingsViaAPIFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceSettingsForNativeApps`
   - `initializeSelfServiceSettingsViaBrowserFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceSettingsForBrowsers`
   - `initializeSelfServiceRecoveryViaAPIFlow` -> `initializeSelfServiceRecoveryForNativeApps`

# [0.6.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.5.5-alpha.1...v0.6.0-alpha.1) (2021-05-05)

Today Ory Kratos v0.6 has been released! We are extremely happy with this release where we made many changes that pave the path for exciting future additions such as integrating 2FA more easily! We would like to thank the awesome community for the many contributions.

Kratos v0.6 includes an insane amount of work spread over the last five months - 480 commits and over 4200 files changed. The team at Ory would like to thank all the amazing contributors that made this release possible!

Here is a summary of the most important changes:

- Ory Kratos now support highly customizable web hooks - contributed by [@dadrus](https://github.com/dadrus) and [@martinei](https://github.com/martinei);
- Ory Kratos Courier can now be run as a standalone task using `kratos courier watch -c your/config.yaml`. To use the mail courier as a background task of the server run `kratos serve --watch-courier` - contributed by [@mattbonnell](https://github.com/mattbonnell);
- Reworked migrations to ensure stable migrations in production systems - backward compatibility is ensured and tested;
- Upgraded to Go 1.16 and removed all static file packers, greatly improving build time;
- Refactored our SDK pipeline from Swagger 2.0 to OpenAPI Spec 3.0. Ory's SDKs are now properly typed and bugs can easily be addressed using a patch process. Due to this, we had to move away from go-swagger client generation for the Go SDK and replace it with openapi-generator. This, unfortunately, introduced breaking changes in the Go SDK APIs. If you have problems migrating, or have a tutorial on how to migrate, please share it with the community on GitHub!
- Created reliable health and status checks by ensuring that e.g. migrations have completed;
- Made resilient CLI client commands e.g. kratos identities list;
- Better support for cookies in multi-domain setups called [domain aliasing](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/guides/configuring-cookies);
- A new, [dynamically generated FAQ](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/faq);
- Enhanced GitHub and Google claims parsing;
- Faster and more resilient CI/CD pipeline;
- Improvements for running Ory Kratos in secure Kubernetes environments;
- Better Helm Charts for Ory Kratos;
- Support for BCrypt hashing, which is now the default hashing implementation. Existing Argon2id hashes will be automatically translated to BCrypt hashes when the user signs in the next time. We recommend using Argon2id in use cases where password hashing is required to take at least 2 seconds. For regular web workloads (200ms) BCrypt is recommended - contributed by [@seremenko-wish](https://github.com/seremenko-wish);
- The Argon2 memory configuration is now human readable: `hashers.argon2.memory: 131072` ->  `hashers.argon2.memory: 131072B` (supports kb, mb, kib, mib, ...).
- Add possibility to keep track of the return_to URLs for verification_flows after sign up using the new `after_verification_return_to` query parameter (e.g. `http://foo.com/registration?after_verification_return_to=verification_callback`) - contributed by [@mattbonnell](https://github.com/mattbonnell);
- Emails are now populated at delivery time, offering more flexibility in terms of templating;
- Emails contain a plaintext variant for email clients that do not display HTML emails - contributed by [@mattbonnell](https://github.com/mattbonnell);
- Mitigation for password hash timing attacks by adding a random delay to login attempts where the user does not exist;
- Resolving SDKs issues for whoami requests;
- Simplified database schema for faster processing, significantly reducing the amount of data stored and latency as several JOINS have been removed;
- Support for binding the HTTP server on UNIX sockets - contributed by [@sloonz](https://github.com/sloonz);

There are even more contributions by [@NickUfer](https://github.com/NickUfer) and [harnash](https://github.com/harnash). In total, [33 people contributed to this release](https://github.com/ory/kratos/graphs/contributors?from=2020-12-09&to=2021-05-04&type=c)! Thank you all!

*IMPORTANT:* Please be aware that the database schema has changed significantly. Applying migrations might, depending on the size of your tables, take a long time. If your database does not support online schema migrations, you will experience downtimes. Please test the migration process before applying it to production!

The probably biggest and most significant change is the refactoring of how self-service flows work and what their payloads look like. This took the most amount of time and introduces the biggest breaking changes in our APIs. We did this refactoring to support several flows planned for Ory Kratos 0.7:

1. Displaying QR codes (images) in login, registration, settings flows - necessary for TOTP 2FA;
2. Asking the login/registration/... UI to render JavaScript - necessary for CAPTCHA, WebAuthN, and more;
3. Refactoring the form submission API to use one endpoint per flow instead of one endpoint per flow per method. This allows us to process several registration/settings/login/... methods such as password + 2FA in one Go.

[Check out how we migrated the NodeJS app](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node/commit/53ad90b6c82cde48994feebcc75d754ba74929ec) from the Ory Kratos 0.5 to Ory Kratos 0.6 SDK.

Let's take a look into how these payloads have changed (the flows have identical configuration):

These changes are analogous to settings, recovery, verification as well!

We hope you enjoy these new features as much as we do, even if we were not able to deliver 2FA in time for 0.6!

On the last note, Ory Platform, a SaaS is launching in May as early access. It includes Ory Kratos as a managed service and we plan on adding all the other Ory open source technology soon. In our view, Ory is a 10x improvement to the existing "IAM" ecosystem:

1. The major components of Ory Platform are and will remain Apache 2.0 licensed open source. We are *not changing our approach or commitment to open source*. The SaaS model allows us to keep commercialization and open source in harmony;
2. Affordable pricing - Ory does not charge on a per identity basis;
3. Supporting migrations from the Ory Platform (SaaS) to the open-source and vice versa;
4. Offering a planet-scale service with ultra-low latencies no matter where your users are;
5. The largest set of features and APIs of any Identity Product, including Identity and Credentials Management (Ory Kratos), Permissions and Access Control (Ory Keto), Zero-Trust Networking (Ory Oathkeeper), OAuth2, and OpenID Connect (Ory Hydra) plus integrations with Stripe, Mailchimp, Salesforce, and much more.
6. Data aggregation for threat mitigation, auditing, and other use cases (e.g. integration with Snowflake, AWS RedShift, GCP BigQuery, ...)
7. All the advantages of the open source projects - headless, fully customizable, strong security, built with a community;
If you wish to become a part of the preview, please write a short email to [sales@ory.sh](mailto:sales@ory.sh). Early access adopters are also eligible for Ory Hypercare - helping you integrate with Ory fast and designing your security architecture following industry best practices.

Thank you for being a part of our community!



## Breaking Changes

BCrypt is now the default hashing alogrithm. If you wish to continue using Argon2id please set `hashers.algorithm` to `argon2`.

This implies a significant breaking change in the verification flow payload. Please consult the new ui documentation. In essence, the login flow's `methods` key was replaced with a generic `ui` key which provides information for the UI that needs to be rendered.

To apply this patch you must apply SQL migrations. These migrations will drop the flow method table implying that all verification flows that are ongoing will become invalid. We recommend purging the flow table manually as well after this migration has been applied, if you have users doing at least one self-service flow per minute.

This implies a significant breaking change in the recovery flow payload. Please consult the new ui documentation. In essence, the login flow's `methods` key was replaced with a generic `ui` key which provides information for the UI that needs to be rendered.

This change introduces a new feature: UI Nodes. Previously, all self-service flows (login, registration, ...) included form fields (e.g. `methods.password.config.fields`). However, these form fields lacked support for other types of UI elements such as links (for e.g. "Sign in with Google"), images (e.g. QR codes), javascript (e.g. WebAuthn), or text (e.g. recovery codes). With this patch, these new features have been introduced. Please be aware that this introduces significant breaking changes which you will need to adopt to in your UI. Please refer to the most recent documentation to see what has changed. Conceptionally, most things stayed the same - you do however need to update how you access and render the form fields.

Please be also aware that this patch includes SQL migrations which **purge existing self-service forms** from the database. This means that users will need to re-start the login/registration/... flow after the SQL migrations have been applied! If you wish to keep these records, make a back up of your database prior!

The configuration value for `hashers.argon2.memory` is now a string representation of the memory amount including the unit of measurement. To convert the value divide your current setting (KB) by 1024 to get a result in MB or 1048576 to get a result in GB. Example: `131072` would now become `128MB`.

Please run SQL migrations when applying this patch.

The following configuration keys were updated:

```patch
selfservice.methods.password.config.max_breaches
```
- `password.max_breaches` -> `selfservice.methods.password.config.max_breaches`
- `password.ignore_network_errors` -> `selfservice.methods.password.config.ignore_network_errors`

After battling with [spf13/viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper) for several years we finally found a viable alternative with [knadh/koanf](https://github.com/knadh/koanf). The complete internal configuration infrastructure has changed, with several highlights:

1. Configuration sourcing works from all sources (file, env, cli flags) with validation against the configuration schema, greatly improving developer experience when changing or updating configuration.
2. Configuration reloading has improved significantly and works flawlessly on Kubernetes.
3. Performance increased dramatically, completely removing the need for a cache layer between the configuration system and ORY Hydra.
4. It is now possible to load several config files using the `--config` flag.
5. Configuration values are now sent to the tracer (e.g. Jaeger) if tracing is enabled.

Please be aware that ORY Kratos might complain about an invalid configuration, because the validation process has improved significantly.

    In some cases we had a wrong bitsize of `64`, while the var was later cast to `int`. Replaced with a bitsize of `0`, which is the value to cast to `int`.

* Contextualize identity persister ([f8640c0](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/f8640c04f0c5873c39c8af4652d16bfbd347b79e))

    Fixes the courier message dequeuing race condition by modifying `*sql.Persister.NextMessages(ctx context.Context, limit uint8)` to retrieve only messages with status `MessageStatusQueued` and update the status of the retrieved messages to `MessageStatusProcessing` within a transaction. On message send failure, the message's status is reset to `MessageStatusQueued`, so that the message can be dequeued in a subsequent `NextMessages` call. On message send success, the status is updated to `MessageStatusSent` (no change there).

    Enabled strategies are not only used for handlers but also in other areas
    (e.g. populating the flow methods). So we should keep the logic to get
    enabled strategies and add new functions for getting all strategies.

* **hashing:** Make bcrypt default hashing algorithm ([04abe77](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/04abe774ada1ef4bf318658fcf84c1d39a2a922d))

    This patch introduces a new SQL transaction model for running SQL migrations. This fix is particularly targeted at CockroachDB which has limited support for mixing DDL and DML statements. 
    
    Previously it could happen that migrations failure needed manual intervention. This has now been resolved. The new migration model is compatible with the old one and should work without a problem.

* Pass down context to registry ([0879446](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/08794461ed95965a9e5460ded2b4c04ab0f5e2e8))

    This PR simplifies the error reason given when a password has appeared in data breaches to not include the actual number and rather just show "this password has appeared in data breaches and must not be used".

    This patch adds the ability to use BCrypt instead of Argon2id for password hashing. We recommend using BCrypt for web workloads where password hashing should take around 200ms. For workloads where login takes >= 2 seconds, we recommend to continue using Argon2id.
    
    To use bcrypt for password hashing, set your config as follows:
    
     ```
    hashers:
     bcrypt:
        cost: 12
      algorithm: bcrypt
     ```
    
    Switching the hashing algorithm will not break existing passwords!

* Courier foreground worker with "kratos courier watch" ([#1062](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1062)) ([500b8ba](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/500b8bacd9fd541afd053f42fec66443cfebabda)), closes [#1033](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1033) [#1024](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/1024):

    BREACKING CHANGES: This patch moves the courier watcher (responsible for sending mail) to its own foreground worker, which can be executed as a, for example, Kubernetes job.
    
    It is still possible to have the previous behaviour which would run the worker as a background task when running `kratos serve` by using the `--watch-courier` flag.
    
    To run the foreground worker, use `kratos courier watch -c your/config.yaml`.

* **courier:** Allow sending individual messages ([cbb2c0b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/cbb2c0bef63323a177589e9d2a809c84b4f1acdd))

* Improve oas spec and fix mobile tests ([4ead2c8](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/4ead2c826a2f1a307e327b9736dd8ac99ef52743))

    Ory Kratos takes a guess based on best practices for
    
    - ordering UI nodes (e.g. email, password, submit button)
    - grouping UI nodes (e.g. keep password and oidc nodes together)
    - labeling UI nodes (e.g. "Sign in with GitHub")
    - using the "title" attribute from the identity schema to label trait fields
    
    This greatly simplifies front-end code on your end and makes it even easier to integrate with Ory Kratos! If you want a custom experience with e.g. translations or other things you can always adjust this in your UI integration!

* Support base64 inline schemas ([815a248](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/815a24890a118f4128ac083241a93d8df27042f7))

    feat: web hooks for self-service flows
    
    This feature adds the ability to define web-hooks using a mixture of configuration and JsonNet. This allows integration with services like Mailchimp, Stripe, CRMs, and all other APIs that support REST requests. Additional to these new changes it is now possible to define hooks for verification and recovery as well!
    
    For more information, head over to the [hooks documentation](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/hooks).

# [0.5.3-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.5.2-alpha.1...v0.5.3-alpha.1) (2020-10-27)

This release improves the developer and user experience around CSRF counter-measures. It should now be possible to use the self-service API flows without having to explicitly disable cookie features in your SDKs and integrations. Additionally, another issue in the CGO pipeline was resolved which finally allows running ORY Kratos without CGO if the target database is not SQLite.

Further improvements to default config values have been made and a full end-to-end test suite for the exemplary [kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native](kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native) app. The app is now available in the iTunes store as well - just search for "ORY Profile App"!

# [0.5.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.4.6-alpha.1...v0.5.0-alpha.1) (2020-10-15)

The ORY team and community is very proud to present the next ORY Kratos iteration!

ORY Kratos is now capable of handling native (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, ...) login, registration, settings, recovery, and verification flows. As a goodie on top, we released a reference React Native application which you can find on [GitHub](http://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-native).

We co-released our reference React Native application which acts as a reference on implementing these flows:

![Registration](http://ory.sh/images/newsletter/kratos-0.5.0/registration-screen.png)

![Welcome](http://ory.sh/images/newsletter/kratos-0.5.0/welcome-screen.png)

![Settings](http://ory.sh/images/newsletter/kratos-0.5.0/settings-screen.png)

In total, almost 1200 files were changed in about 480 commits. While you can find a list of all changes in the changelist below, these are the changes we are most proud of:

- We renamed login, registration, ... requests to "flows" consistently across the code base, APIs, and data storage. We now:
  - Initiate a login, registration, ... flow;
  - Fetch a login, registration, ... flow; and
  - Complete a login, registration, ... flow using a login flow method such as "Log in with username and password".
- All self-service flows are now capable of handling API-based requests that do not originate from Browser such as Chrome. This is set groundwork for handling native flows (see above)!
- The self service documentation has been refactored and simplified. We added code samples, screenshots, payloads, and curl commands to make things easier and clearer to understand. Video guides have also been added to help you and the community get things done faster!
- Documentation for rotating important secrets such as the cookie and session secrets was added.
- The need for reverse proxies was removed by adding the ability to change the ORY Kratos Session Cookie domain and path! The [kratos-selfservice-ui-node](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node) reference implementation no longer requires HTTP Request piping which greatly simplifies the network layout and codebase!
- The ORY Kratos CLI is now capable of managing identities with an interface that works almost like the Docker CLI we all love!
- Admins are now able to initiate account recovery for identities.
- Email verification and account recovery were refactored. It is now possible to add additional strategies (e.g. recovery codes) in the future, greatly increasing the feature set and security capabilities of future ORY Kratos versions!
- Lookup to Have I Been Pwnd is no longer a hard requirement, allowing registration processes to complete when the service is unavailable or the network is slow.
- We contributed several issues and features in upstream projects such as justinas/nosurf, gobuffalo/pop, and many more!
- The build pipeline has been upgraded to support cross-compilation of CGO with Go 1.15+.
- Fetching flows no longer requires CSRF cookies to be set, improving developer experience while not compromising on security!
- ORY Kratos now has ORY Kratos Session Cookies (set in the HTTP Cookie header) and ORY Kratos Session Tokens (set as a HTTP Bearer Authorization token or the `X-Session-Token` HTTP Header).

Additionally tons of bugs were fixed, tests added, documentation improved, and much more. Please note that several things have changed in a breaking fashion. You can find details for the individual breaking changes in the changelog below.

## Breaking Changes

The "common" keyword has been removed from the Swagger 2.0 spec which deprecates the `common` module / package / class (depending on the generated SDK). Please use `public` or `admin` instead!

Additionally, the SDK for TypeScript now uses the `fetch` API which allows the SDK to be used in both client-side as well as server-side contexts. Please note that several methods and parameters in the generated TypeScript SDK have changed. Please check the TypeScript results to see what needs to be changed!

This patch changes the OpenID Connect and OAuth2 ("Sign in with Google, Facebook, ...") Callback URL from `http(s)://<kratos-public>/self-service/browser/flows/strategies/oidc/<provider>` to `http(s)://<kratos-public>/self-service/methods/oidc/<provider>`. To apply this patch, you need to update these URLs at the OAuth2 Client configuration pages of the individual OpenID Conenct providers (e.g. GitHub, Google).

Configuration key `selfservice.strategies` was renamed to `selfservice.methods`.

This patch significantly changes how email verification works. The Verification Flow no longer uses its own system but now re-uses the API and Browser flows and flow methods established in other components such as login, recovery, registration.

Due to the many changes these patch notes does not cover how to upgrade this particular flow. We instead want to kindly ask you to check out the updated documentation for this flow at: https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/verify-email-account-activation

This patch changes the SQL schema and thus requires running the SQL Migration command (e.g. `... migrate sql`).
Never apply SQL migrations without backing up your database prior.

Configuration items `selfservice.flows.<name>.request_lifespan` have been renamed to `selfservice.flows.<name>.lifespan` to match the new flow semantics.

Wording has changed from "Self-Service Recovery Request" to "Self-Service Recovery Flow" to follow community feedback and practice already applied in the documentation. Additionally, fetching a recovery flow over the public API no longer requires Anti-CSRF cookies to be sent.

This patch renames several important recovery flow endpoints:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/recovery` is now `/self-service/recovery/browser` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/requests/recovery?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/recovery/flows?id=abcd` and no longer needs anti-CSRF cookies to be available.

Additionally, the URL for completing the password and oidc recovery method has been moved. Given that this endpoint is typically not manually called, you can probably ignore this change:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/recovery/link?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/recovery/methods/link?flow=abcd` without functional changes.

The Recovery UI Endpoint no longer receives a `?request=abcde` query parameter but instead a `?flow=abcde` query parameter. Functionality did not change however.

As part of this change SDK methods have been renamed:

```
  const kratos = new CommonApi(config.kratos.public)
  // ...
- kratos.completeSelfServiceBrowserRecoveryLinkStrategyFlow(req.query.request)
+ kratos.completeSelfServiceRecoveryFlowWithLinkMethod(req.query.flow)
```

This patch requires you to run SQL migrations.

Wording has changed from "Self-Service Settings Request" to "Self-Service Settings Flow" to follow community feedback and practice already applied in the documentation.

This patch renames several important settings flow endpoints:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/settings` is now `/self-service/settings/browser` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/requests/settings?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/settings/flows?id=abcd` and no longer needs anti-CSRF cookies to be available.

Additionally, the URL for completing the password, profile, and oidc settings method has been moved. Given that this endpoint is typically not manually called, you can probably ignore this change:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/login/strategies/password?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=abcd` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/strategies/oidc?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/methods/oidc?flow=abcd` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/settings/strategies/profile?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/settings/methods/profile?flow=abcd` without functional changes.

The Settings UI Endpoint no longer receives a `?request=abcde` query parameter but instead a `?flow=abcde` query parameter. Functionality did not change however.

As part of this change SDK methods have been renamed:

```
  const kratos = new CommonApi(config.kratos.public)
  // ...
- kratos.getSelfServiceBrowserSettingsRequest(req.query.request)
+ kratos.getSelfServiceSettingsFlow(req.query.flow)

  // You will most likely not be using this:
  const kratos = new PublicApi(config.kratos.public)
- kratos.completeSelfServiceBrowserSettingsPasswordStrategyFlow //...
- kratos.completeSelfServiceSettingsFlowWithPasswordMethod //..
- kratos.completeSelfServiceBrowserSettingsProfileStrategyFlow //...
- kratos.completeSelfServiceSettingsFlowWithProfileMethod //..
```

This patch requires you to run SQL migrations.

This patch makes the reverse proxy functionality required in prior versions of the self-service UI example obsolete. All examples work now with a simple set up and documentation has been added to assist in subdomain scenarios.

The session field `sid` has been renamed to `id` to stay consistent with other APIs which also use `id` terminology to clarify identifiers. The payload of, for example, `/session/whoami` has changed as follows:

```patch
  {
-   "sid": "abcde",
+   "id": "abcde",
    "expires_at": "..."
    "identity": {
      // ..
    }
  }
```

Wording has changed from "Self-Service Registration Request" to "Self-Service Registration Flow" to follow community feedback and practice already applied in the documentation. Additionally, fetching a login flow over the public API no longer requires Anti-CSRF cookies to be sent.

This patch renames several important registration flow endpoints:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/registration` is now `/self-service/registration/browser` without behavioral change.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/requests/registration?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/registration/flows?id=abcd` and no longer needs anti-CSRF cookies to be available.

Additionally, the URL for completing the password registration method has been moved. Given that this endpoint is typically not manually called, you can probably ignore this change:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/registration/strategies/password?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/registration/methods/password?flow=abcd` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/strategies/oidc?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/methods/oidc?flow=abcd` without functional changes.

The Registration UI Endpoint no longer receives a `?request=abcde` query parameter but instead a `?flow=abcde` query parameter. Functionality did not change however.

As part of this change SDK methods have been renamed:

```
  const kratos = new CommonApi(config.kratos.public)
  // ...
- kratos.getSelfServiceBrowserRegistrationRequest(req.query.request)
+ kratos.getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow(req.query.flow)
```

This patch requires you to run SQL migrations.

Existing login sessions will no longer be valid because the session cookie data model changed. If you apply this patch, your users will need to sign in again.

Wording has changed from "Self-Service Login Request" to "Self-Service Login Flow" to follow community feedback and practice already applied in the documentation. Additionally, fetching a login flow over the public API no longer requires Anti-CSRF cookies to be sent.

This patch renames several important login flow endpoints:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/login` is now `/self-service/login/browser` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/requests/login?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/login/flows?id=abcd` and no longer needs anti-CSRF cookies to be available.

Additionally, the URL for completing the password and oidc login method has been moved. Given that this endpoint is typically not manually called, you can probably ignore this change:

- `/self-service/browser/flows/login/strategies/password?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/login/methods/password?flow=abcd` without functional changes.
- `/self-service/browser/flows/strategies/oidc?request=abcd` is now `/self-service/methods/oidc?flow=abcd` without functional changes.

The Login UI Endpoint no longer receives a `?request=abcde` query parameter but instead a `?flow=abcde` query parameter. Functionality did not change however.

As part of this change SDK methods have been renamed:

```
  const kratos = new CommonApi(config.kratos.public)
  // ...
- kratos.getSelfServiceBrowserLoginRequest(req.query.request)
+ kratos.getSelfServiceLoginFlow(req.query.flow)
```

This patch requires you to run SQL migrations.

Configuraiton value `session.cookie_same_site` has moved to `session.cookie.same_site`. There was no functional change.

    The old code no error when ignoreNetworkErrors was set to true, but did not set a hash result which caused an infinite loop.

    Executing the migration logic in registry.go cause a panic as the registry is not initalized at that point. Therefore we decided to move the handling to driver_default.go, after the registry has been initialized.

* Swagger models ([1b5f9ab](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/1b5f9abd5d82251ab93a05d4ff26b4c48c8151ca)):

    The `swagger:parameters <id>` definitions for `updateIdentity` and `createIdentity` where defined two times with the same ID. They had some old definition swagger used. The `internal/httpclient` should now work again as expected.

* Tell tls what the smtps server name is ([#634](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/634)) ([b724038](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/b724038a67e84ca71b146bf4b9b044be2dc8c0b4))

### Code Generation

* Pin v0.5.0-alpha.1 release commit ([557d37d](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/557d37d1139adb14a25abe40d0174d47d4e18fee))

* Add flow methods to verification ([00ee828](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/00ee828842bd4bc6f917ba2446b1374d28b62000)):

    Completely refactors the verification flow to support other methods. The original email verification flow now moved to the "link" method also used for recovery.
    
    Additionally, several upstream bugs in gobuffalo/pop and gobuffalo/fizz have been addressed, patched, and merged which improves support for SQLite and CockroachDB migrations:
    
    - https://github.com/gobuffalo/fizz/pull/97

# [0.4.3-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.4.2-alpha.1...v0.4.3-alpha.1) (2020-07-08)

We are very happy to announce the 0.4 release of ORY Kratos with 163 commits and 817 changed files with 52,681 additions and 9,876 deletions.

There have been many improvements and bugfixes merged. The biggest changes are:

1. Account recovery ("reset password") has been implemented.
2. Documentation has been improved with easier to understand examples - currently only for account recovery so let us know what you think!
3. The configuration has been simplified a lot. It is now much easier to enable account recovery and email verification. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
4. The Identity Traits JSON Schema has been renamed to the Identity JSON Schema. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
5. `prompt=login` has been renamed to `refresh=true`. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
6. We have reworked how (error) messages are returned. They now include an ID and all the parameters required for translating and customizing UI messages. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
7. Instead of keeping track of `update_successful` with booleans, flows (e.g. the settings flow) that have more than one state now include a state machine. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
8. Tons of tests have been added.
9. We have reworked and fully tested the migration pipeline to prevent breaking schema changes in future versions.
10. ORY Kratos now supports login with Azure AD and the Microsoft Identity Platform.

Before upgrading, please make a backup of your database and read the section "Breaking Changes" with care!

We are very happy to announce the 0.4 release of ORY Kratos with 153 commits and 760 changed files with 36,223 additions and 9,754 deletions.

There have been many improvements and bugfixes merged. The biggest changes are:

1. Account recovery ("reset password") has been implemented.
2. Documentation has been improved with easier to understand examples - currently only for account recovery so let us know what you think!
3. The configuration has been simplified a lot. It is now much easier to enable account recovery and email verification. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
4. The Identity Traits JSON Schema has been renamed to the Identity JSON Schema. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
5. `prompt=login` has been renamed to `refresh=true`. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
6. We have reworked how (error) messages are returned. They now include an ID and all the parameters required for translating and customizing UI messages. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
7. Instead of keeping track of `update_successful` with booleans, flows (e.g. the settings flow) that have more than one state now include a state machine. This is a breaking change - please read the breaking changes section with care!
8. Tons of tests have been added.
9. We have reworked and fully tested the migration pipeline to prevent breaking schema changes in future versions.
10. ORY Kratos now supports login with Azure AD and the Microsoft Identity Platform.

Before upgrading, please make a backup of your database and read the section "Breaking Changes" with care! This release requires running SQL migrations when upgrading!



## Breaking Changes

This patch renames the Identity Traits JSON Schema to Identity JSON Schema.

The identity payload has changed from

```
 {
-  "traits_schema_url": "...",
-  "traits_schema_id": "...",
+  "schema_url": "...",
+  "schema_id": "...",
 }
```

Additionally, it is now expected that your Identity JSON Schema includes a "traits" key at the
root level.

**Before (example)**

```
{
  "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "email": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "email",
      "title": "E-Mail",
      "minLength": 3,
      "ory.sh/kratos": {
        "credentials": {
          "password": {
            "identifier": true
          }
        },
        "verification": {
          "via": "email"
        },
        "recovery": {
          "via": "email"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "email"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**After (example)**

```
{
  "$id": "https://schemas.ory.sh/presets/kratos/quickstart/email-password/identity.schema.json",
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Person",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "traits": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "title": "E-Mail",
          "minLength": 3,
          "ory.sh/kratos": {
            "credentials": {
              "password": {
                "identifier": true
              }
            },
            "verification": {
              "via": "email"
            },
            "recovery": {
              "via": "email"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "email"
      ],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }
  }
}
```

You also need to remove the `traits` key from your ORY Kratos config like this:

```
 identity:
-   traits:
-     default_schema_url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh/default-identity.schema.json
-     schemas:
-       - id: other
-         url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh/other-identity.schema.json
+   default_schema_url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh/default-identity.schema.json
+   schemas:
+     - id: other
+       url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh/other-identity.schema.json
```

Do not forget to also update environment variables for the Identity JSON Schema as well if set.

To address these refactorings, the configuration had to be changed and with breaking changes
as keys have moved or have been removed.

Hook configuration has also changed. It is no longer required to include hooks such as `verification` to get
verification working. Instead, verification is enabled globally (`selfservice.flows.verification.enabled`).
Also, the `redirect` hook has been removed as it lead to confusion because there are already default redirect
URLs configurable. You will find more information in the details below.

**Session Management**

```diff
-ttl:
-  session: 1h
-security:
-  session:
-    cookie:
-      same_site: Lax
+session:
+  lifespan: 1h
+  cookie_same_site: Lax
```

**Secrets**

```diff
-secrets:
-  session:
-    - secret-to-encrypt-session-cookies
-    - old-session-cookie-secret-that-has-been-rotated
+secrets:
+  default:
+    # This secret is used as default and will also be used for encrypting e.g. cookies when a dedicated cookie secret (as shown below) is not defined.
+    - default-secret-to-encrypt-stuff
+  cookie:
+    - secret-to-encrypt-session-cookies
+    - old-session-cookie-secret-that-has-been-rotated
```

**URLs**

The Base URL configuration has moved to `serve.public` and `serve.admin`. They are also no longer required and fall
back to defaults based on the machine's hostname, port configuration, and other settings:

```diff
-urls:
-  self:
-    public: https://kratos.my-website.com/
-    admin: https://admin.kratos.cluster.localnet/
+serve:
+  public:
+    base_url: https://kratos.my-website.com/
+  admin:
+    base_url: https://admin.kratos.cluster.localnet/
```

The UI URLs have moved from `urls` to their respective self-service flows:

```diff
-urls:
-  login_ui: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login
-  registration_ui: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/registration
-  settings_ui: http://127.0.0.1:4455/settings
-  verify_ui: http://127.0.0.1:4455/verify
-  error_ui: http://127.0.0.1:4455/error
+selfservice:
+  flows:
+    login:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login
+    registration:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/registration
+    settings:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/settings
+    # please note that `verify` has changed to `verification`!
+    verification:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/verify
+    error:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/error
```

The default redirect URL as well as whitelisted redirect URLs have also changed their location:

```diff
-urls:
-  default_return_to: https://self-service/dashboard
-  whitelisted_return_to_urls:
-    - https://self-service/some-other-url
-    - https://example.org/another-url
+selfservice:
+  default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/dashboard
#  Please note that the `to` has been removed (`whitelisted_return_to_urls` -> `whitelisted_return_urls`)
+  whitelisted_return_urls:
+    - https://self-service/some-other-url
+    - https://example.org/another-url
```

**Self-Service Login**

`selfservice.login` has moved to `selfservice.flow.login`:

```diff
 selfservice:
-  login:
+  flows:
+    login:
```

On top of this change, a few keys under `login` have changed as well:

```diff
 selfservice
   flows:
     login:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/login
       request_lifespan: 99m
-      before:
-        hooks:
-          - hook: redirect
-            config:
-              default_redirect_url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh:4000/
-              allow_user_defined_redirect: false
+      # The before hooks have been removed because there were no good use cases for them. If
+      # this is a problem for you feel free to open an issue!

     after:
-      default_return_to: https://self-service/login/return_to
+      default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/login/return_to
       password:
-         default_return_to: https://self-service/login/password/return_to
+         default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/login/password/return_to
          hooks:
            - hook: revoke_active_sessions
       oidc:
-         default_return_to: https://self-service/login/podc/return_to
+         default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/login/podc/return_to
          hooks:
            - hook: revoke_active_sessions
```

**Self-Service Registration**

`selfservice.registration` has moved from to `selfservice.flow.registration`:

```diff
 selfservice:
-  registration:
+  flows:

```diff
 selfservice
   flows:
     registration:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/auth/registration
       request_lifespan: 99m
-      before:
-        hooks:
-          - hook: redirect
-            config:
-              default_redirect_url: http://test.kratos.ory.sh:4000/
-              allow_user_defined_redirect: false
+      # The before hooks have been removed because there were no good use cases for them. If
+      # this is a problem for you feel free to open an issue!

     after:
-      default_return_to: https://self-service/registration/return_to
+      default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/registration/return_to
       password:
-        default_return_to: https://self-service/registration/password/return_to
+        default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/registration/password/return_to
         hooks:
           - hook: revoke_active_sessions
+          # The verify hook is now executed automatically when verification is turned on.
-          - hook: verify
+          # The redirect hook was confusing as it aborts the registration flow and does not solve redirection on
+          # success. It has thus been removed.
-          - hook: redirect
       oidc:
-        default_return_to: https://self-service/registration/podc/return_to
+        default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/registration/podc/return_to
         hooks:
           - hook: revoke_active_sessions
+          # The verify hook is now executed automatically when verification is turned on.
-          - hook: verify
+          # The redirect hook was confusing as it aborts the registration flow and does not solve redirection on
+          # success. It has thus been removed.
-          - hook: redirect
```

**Self-Service Settings**

`selfservice.settings` has moved from to `selfservice.flow.settings`:

```diff
 selfservice:
-  settings:
+  flows:
+    settings:
```

On top of this change, a few keys under `settings` have changed as well:

```diff
 selfservice
   flows:
     settings:
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/settings
       request_lifespan: 99m
       privileged_session_max_age: 99m
-      default_return_to: https://self-service/settings/return_to
       after:
+        default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/settings/return_to
+        # The profile/password after hooks have been removed as verification is now executed automatically
+        # when turned on.
-        password:
-          hooks:
-            - hook: verify
-        profile:
-          hooks:
-            - hook: verify
```

**Self-Service Verification**

`selfservice.verify` has moved from to `selfservice.flow.verification`:

```diff
 selfservice:
-  verify:
+  flows:
+    verification:
```

Instead of configuring verification with hooks and other components, it can now be enabled
in a central place. If enabled, a SMTP server must be configured in the `courier` section.
You are still required to mark a field as verifiable in your Identity JSON Schema.

```diff
 selfservice:
   flows:
     verification:
+      enabled: true # defaults to true
+      ui_url: http://127.0.0.1:4455/recovery
       request_lifespan: 1m
-      default_return_to: https://self-service/verification/return_to
       after:
+        default_browser_return_url: https://self-service/verification/return_to
```

Replaces the `update_successful` field of the settings request
with a field called `state` which can be either `show_form` or `success`.

Flows, request methods, form fields have had a key errors to show e.g. validation errors such as ("not an email address", "incorrect username/password", and so on. The `errors` key is now called `messages`. Each message now has a `type` which can be `error` or `info`, an `id` which can be used to translate messages, a `text` (which was previously errors[*].message). This affects all login, request, settings, and recovery flows and methods.

To refresh a login session it is now required to append `refresh=true` instead of `prompt=login` as the second has implications for revoking an existing issue and might be confusing when used in combination with OpenID Connect.

* Applying this patch requires running SQL Migrations.
* The field `identity.addresses` has moved to `identity.verifiable_addresses`.
* Configuration key `selfservice.verification.link_lifespan`
has been merged with  `selfservice.verification.request_lifespan`.

    This patch implements the account recovery with endpoints such as "Init Account Recovery", a new config value `urls.recovery_ui` and so on. A new identity field has been added `identity.recovery_addresses` containing all recovery addresses.
    
    Additionally, some refactoring was made to DRY code and make naming consistent. As part of dependency upgrades, structured logging has also improved and an audit trail prototype has been added (currently streams to stderr only).

# [0.3.0-alpha.1](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.2.1-alpha.1...v0.3.0-alpha.1) (2020-05-15)

This release finalizes the OpenID Connect and OAuth2 login, registration, and settings strategy with JsonNet data transformation! From now on, "Sign in with Google, Github, ..." is officially supported! It's also possible to link and unlink these connections using the Self-Service Settings Flow! The documentation has been updated to reflect those changes and includes guides to setting up "Sign in with GitHub" in under 5 Minutes! Please be aware that existing OpenID Connect connections will stop working. Check out the "Breaking Changes" section for more info! Want to learn more? Check [out the docs](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/concepts/credentials/openid-connect-oidc-oauth2)!

We also changed the config validation output, making it easier than ever to find bugs in your config:

```
% kratos --config invalid-config.yml serve
INFO[0001] Config file loaded successfully.              path=invalid-config.yml
ERRO[0001] The provided configuration is invalid and could not be loaded. Check the output below to understand why.  config_file=invalid-config.yml

dsn: <nil>
     ^-- one or more required properties are missing

urls.whitelisted_return_to_urls: https://selfservice.office.example.com
                                 ^-- expected array, but got string

FATA[0001] The services failed to start because the configuration is invalid. Check the output above for more details.
```

This release concludes over 50 commits and 16.000 lines of code changed.



## Breaking Changes

If you upgrade and have existing Social Sign In connections, it will no longer be possible to use them to sign in. Because the oidc strategy was undocumented and not officially released we do not provide an upgrade guide. If you run into this issue on a production system you may need to use SQL to change the config of those identities. If this is a real issue for you that you're unable to solve, please create an issue on GitHub.

This is a breaking change as previous OIDC configurations will not work. Please consult the newly written documentation on OpenID Connect to learn how to use OIDC in your login and registration flows. Since the OIDC feature was not publicly broadcasted yet we have chosen not to provide an upgrade path. If you have issues, please reach out on the forums or slack.

* Moved scanner json to ory/x ([#412](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/412)) ([8a0967d](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/8a0967daef4329981b01e6c2b8bb55a8105b4829))
* Partition files and change creds structure ([4f1eb94](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/4f1eb946fe1e74e537fc2166fc000180a11c2048)):

    This patch changes the data model of the OpenID Connect strategy. Instead of using an array of providers as the base config item (e.g. `{"type":"oidc","config":[{"provider":"google","subject":"..."}]}`) the credentials config is now an object with a `providers` key: `{"type":"oidc","config":{"providers":[{"provider":"google","subject":"..."}]}}`. This change allows introduction of future changes to the schema without breaking compatibility.

* Replace oidc jsonschema with jsonnet ([2b45e79](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/2b45e7953787ad46a6937fe44cb24b6c786eb223)), closes [#380](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/380):

    This patch replaces the previous methodology of merging OIDC data which used JSON Schema with Extensions and JSON Path in favor of a much easier to use approach with JSONNet.

* **settings:** Use common request parser ([ad6c402](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/ad6c4026e5fd15924dc906cdc9cb6c9de2fc4daa))

# [0.2.0-alpha.2](https://github.com/ory/kratos/compare/v0.1.1-alpha.1...v0.2.0-alpha.2) (2020-05-04)

This is a heavy release with over hundreds of commits and files changed! Let's
take a look at some of the highlights!

**ORY Oathkeeper now optional**

Using ORY Oathkeeper to protect your API is now optional. The basic quickstart
now uses a much simpler set up. Go
[check it out](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/quickstart) now!

**PostgreSQL, MySQL, CockroachDB support now tested and official!**

All three databases now pass acceptance tests and are thus officially supported!

**Self-Service Profile Flow**

The self-service profile flow has been refactored into a more generic flow
allowing users to make modifications to their traits and credentials. Check out
the [docs to learn
more](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-settings-profile-management)
about the flow and it's features.

Please keep in mind that the flow's APIs have changed. We recommend re-reading
the docs!

**Managing Privileged Profile Fields**

Flows such as changing ones profile or primary email address should not be
possible unless the login session is fresh. This prevents your colleague or evil
friend to take over your account while you make yourself a coffee.

ORY Kratos now supports this by redirecting the user to the login screen if
changes to sensitive fields are made. The changes will only be applied after
successful reauthentication.

**Changes to Hooks**

This patch focuses on refactoring how self-service flows terminate and changes
how hooks behave and when they are executed.

Before this patch, it was not clear whether hooks run before or after an
identity is persisted. This caused problems with multiple writes on the HTTP
ResponseWriter and other bugs.

This patch removes certain hooks from after login, registration, and profile
flows. Per default, these flows now respond with an appropriate payload (
redirect for browsers, JSON for API clients) and deprecate the `redirect` hook.
This patch includes documentation which explains how these hooks work now.

Additionally, the documentation was updated. Especially the sections about hooks
have been refactored. The login and user registration docs have been updated to
reflect the latest changes as well.

BREAKING CHANGE: Please remove the `redirect` hook from both login,
registration, and settings after configuration. Please remove the `session` hook
from your login after configuration. Hooks have moved down a level and are now
configured at `selfservice.<login|registration|settings>.<after|before>.hooks`
instead of `selfservice.<login|registration|settings>.<after|before>.hooks`.
Hooks are now identified by `hook:` instead of `job:`. Please rename those
sections accordingly.

We recommend re-reading the
[Hooks Documentation](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/hooks/index).

**Changing Passwords**

It's now possible to change your password using the Self-Service Settings Flow!
Lean more about this flow
[here](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-settings-profile-management)

**End-To-End Tests**

We added tons of end-to-end and integration tests to find and fix pesky bugs.



## Breaking Changes

Please remove the `redirect` hook from both login,
registration, and settings after configuration. Please remove
the `session` hook from your login after configuration. Hooks
have moved down a level and are now configured at
`selfservice.<login|registration|settings>.<after|before>.hooks`
instead of
`selfservice.<login|registration|settings>.<after|before>.hooks`.
Hooks are now identified by `hook:` instead of `job:`. Please
rename those sections accordingly.

Several profile-related URLs have and payloads been updated. Please consult the most recent documentation.

The payloads of the Profile Management Request API
that previously were set in `{ "methods": { "traits": { ... } }}` have now moved to
`{ "methods": { "profile": { ... } }}`.

This patch introduces a refactor that is needed
for the profile management API to be capable of handling (password,
oidc, ...) credential changes as well.

To implement this, the payloads of the Profile Management Request API
that previously were set in `{"form": {...} }` have now moved to
`{"methods": { "traits": { ... } }}`.

In the future, as more credential updates are handled, there will
be additional keys in the forms key
`{"methods": { "traits": { ... }, "password": { ... } }}`.



### Bug Fixes

* Allow setting new password in profile flow ([3b5fd5c](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/3b5fd5ca8c09b2344c0262547f2b387bda362362))

    Creates several docker compose examples which include various
    scenarios of the quickstart.
    
    The regular quickstart guide now works without ORY Oathkeeper
    and uses the standalone mode of the example app instead.
    
    Additionally, the Makefile was improved and now automatically pulls
    required dependencies in the appropriate version.

* **docker:** Throw away build artifacts ([481ec1b](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/481ec1ba14480ced39516f6e0c47a40b6a44a631))

    This patch adds a module which is capable of aborting a request, waiting for
    another option to complete, and then resuming the request again.

    fields such as passwords, 2fa recovery codes, email addresses.

    This patch refactors user-facing error APIs:
    
    - The `/errors` endpoint moved to `/self-service/errors`
    - The endpoint is now available at both the Admin and Public API. The Public API requires CSRF Token match or a 403 error will be returned.
    - The Public API endpoint no longer returns 404 errors but 403 instead.
    - The response payload changed. What was `[{"code": ...}]` is now `{"id": "...", "errors": [{"code": ...}]}`
    
    This patch requires running `kratos migrate sql` as a new column (`csrf_token`) has been added to the user-facing error store.

    Due to a bug in `go-acc`, tests would not run if `-tags sqlite` was supplied as a go tool argument to `go-acc`. This patch resolves that issue and also includes several test patches from previous community PRs and some internal test issues.

* Add ORY Kratos banner to README (#145) ([23b824f](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/23b824f7f99efbc23787508c03506e73a3240a2a)), closes [#145](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/145)
* Replace DBAL layer with gobuffalo/pop (#130) ([21d08b8](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/21d08b84560230d8a063a418a74efcf53c146872)), closes [#130](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/130):

    This is a major refactoring of the internal DBAL. After a successful proof of concept and evaluation of gobuffalo/pop, we believe this to be the best DBAL for Go at the moment. It abstracts a lot of boilerplate code away.
    
    As with all sophisticated DBALs, pop too has its quirks. There are several issues that have been discovered during testing and adoption: https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop/issues/136 https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop/issues/476 https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop/issues/473 https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop/issues/469 https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop/issues/466
    
    However, the upside of moving much of the hard database/sql plumbing into another library cleans up the code base significantly and reduces complexity.
    
    As part of this change, the "ephermal" DBAL ("in memory") will be removed and sqlite will be used instead. This further reduces complexity of the code base and code-duplication.
    
    To support sqlite, CGO is required, which means that we need to run tests with `go test -tags sqlite` on a machine that has g++ installed. This also means that we need a Docker Image with `alpine` as opposed to pure `scratch`. While this is certainly a downside, the upside of less maintenance and "free" support for SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and CockroachDB simply outweighs any downsides that come with CGO.

* Replace local deps with remote ones ([8605e45](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/8605e454cf538e047c5a9c3479372892d6b3f483))

    All identity traits schemas have to be configured using a human readable ID and the corresponding URL. This PR enables multiple schemas to be used next to the default schema.
    It also adds the kratos.public/schemas/:id endpoint that mirrors all schemas.

* Add helper for requiring authentication ([3888fbd](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/3888fbdc239b7a06c7fca34d08de7d55af69a48c))

    This patch adds a hook that destroys all active session by the identity which is being logged in. This can be useful in scenarios where only one session should be active at any given time.

* Add SQL adapter ([#100](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/100)) ([9e7f998](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/9e7f99871e3f09e7ae9ec1c38c8b8cf94d076f45)), closes [#92](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/92)
* Explicitly whitelist form parser keys ([#105](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/105)) ([28b056e](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/28b056e5bbfec645262914c52f0386d70c787a32)), closes [#98](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/98):

    Previously the form parser would try to detect the field type by
    asserting types for the whole form. That caused passwords
    containing only numbers to fail to unmarshal into a string
    value.
    
    This patch resolves that issue by introducing a prefix
    option to the BodyParser

    Because this module is primarily used
    in selfservice scenarios, it has been
    moved to the selfservice parent.

* Omit request header from login/registration request ([#106](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/106)) ([9b07587](https://github.com/ory/kratos/commit/9b07587f2de2b270c5c326e37b2b6b3dbbfa8595)), closes [#95](https://github.com/ory/kratos/issues/95):

    When fetching a login and registration request, the HTTP Request Headers
    must not be included in the response, as they contain irrelevant
    information for the API caller.
