    title: Ory Kratos API
    description: |
      Documentation for all public and administrative Ory Kratos APIs. Public and administrative APIs
      are exposed on different ports. Public APIs can face the public internet without any protection
      while administrative APIs should never be exposed without prior authorization. To protect
      the administative API port you should use something like Nginx, Ory Oathkeeper, or any other
      technology capable of authorizing incoming requests.
